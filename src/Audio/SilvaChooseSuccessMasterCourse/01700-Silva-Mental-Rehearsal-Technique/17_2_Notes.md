With the Mental Rehearsal Technique, you're totally involved because you are the one doing it. 

You're not observing yourself doing it, you're doing it.

`Shin splints` are pain along the shin bone, also called the tibia. The tibia is the large bone in the front of the lower leg. Shin splints are common in runners, dancers and military trainees.

You can enter your level, state the problem, state the goal, make a plan, work the plan, and go get your results.
