We've got a technique for you now that's not taught in the basic lecture series. We've included it here because it's a terrific self-programming technique. It's called the Silva Mental Rehearsal Technique.

This technique is for practicing skills mentally so that you can perform them better physically. In many respects, it's similar to the Mirror of the Mind. You can use it in addition to the Mirror of the Mind or instead of it.

Whatever works best for you. As always, let your results guide you in your programming. You notice when you use the Mirror of the Mind, it's like you step outside of the scene and observe the scene.

By doing this, you can watch yourself in a detached manner. It's like watching a movie of yourself. It's like you're watching yourself as an actor performing what you want to perform.

With the Mental Rehearsal Technique, you're totally involved because you are the one doing it. You're not observing yourself doing it, you're doing it. For instance, let's say that you want to program yourself to be more assertive.

Actually, there's a lot of techniques that you can use for this. A lot of things to apply to this problem. For instance, as we learned earlier, you can simply program with words.

You can enter your level, state the problem, state the goal, make a plan, work the plan, and go get your results. Just like with, remember, the Headache Control, the Awake Control techniques. You could say, I'm unassertive, I want to be assertive, etc., etc.

Or you can incorporate visualization and imagination by using the Mirror of the Mind. Create a picture of the problem in the blue frame mirror. Make a mental movie.

Study what you did. Make a good study of the problem by observing how you act and react, and then erase the problem. Turn off the movie and erase the problem.

Move the mirror over, change the frame to white, and create a solution image in the white frame mirror. Make a mental movie of yourself acting and reacting the way you desire. Now, with the Mental Rehearsal technique, you can go back and mentally relive the actual situation that you were involved with.

You can go through the experience again, mentally. Then, you can imagine acting differently. You can imagine being more assertive.

This can be very beneficial. After all, you're not really facing the person, so you can act any way you want to in your imagination. You can determine where the blocks are, the things that make you feel the most nervous, the things that are the most intimidating to you, and you can practice mentally over and over as much as you want to, until you can do it with confidence.

The Mirror of the Mind is like watching a movie of somebody doing it, even yourself. The Mental Rehearsal technique is like you're doing it yourself. `In one case, you're the audience. In the other, you are a full-fledged participant.` 

Now, feelings are important for your programming. The more you can get your feelings involved, the more effective your programming will be. You may find that it's easier to get your feelings involved when you use the Mental Rehearsal technique. Recall the feeling of being intimidated, for instance, if this happens to you. Then, as you rehearse mentally, or when you use the Mirror of the Mind, same thing, imagine the feeling you get when you stand up for yourself.

If you've done this previously, had a situation where you stood up for yourself, where you were assertive, then recall what that felt like. If you haven't had that experience before, then you may have to imagine it to begin with, and as you have it, remember, when you had that experience physically, go to your level, establish points of reference for it, recall what it feels like, review it at level, over and over again, so it'll be easy for you to program the next time. 

Now, whenever you use the Mental Rehearsal technique, it's important that you know the correct way to perform. If you're not sure of what you should be doing, then do not use this technique. Use the Mirror of the Mind, where you just create a mental picture of the final end result. 

For instance, let's say you need to make a speech or give a talk somewhere, before a group of people. This is one of the biggest fears that human beings have. With the Mirror of the Mind, you could watch yourself making an excellent speech. You can sit back and relax, so to speak, and enjoy your performance.

You simply program that kind of image, at your level, in the White Frame Mirror, and do all that you can to prepare for the speech, so that you'll be fully prepared when you actually go and deliver it. There are several techniques, by the way, that can help you prepare for a speech. Remember the Memory Pegs, the Three Fingers technique? Use the techniques that'll help you.

Now, perhaps you're already making speeches from time to time, and you know what it feels like, and you've even delivered a pretty good speech that got a good reaction. You interacted with the audience, you got responses from them, you kept them interested all the way through, so you know what it's like. This is a great time, then, to go back and mentally rehearse at your level.

The next speech you're going to make, imagine yourself up in front of the group of people, talking to them. Imagine their response to you, as they watch you, as they make eye contact with you, as they begin to get the realization of what you're talking about, and how that can be beneficial to them. As your words actually help them, notice their reactions.

See, if you know what to expect from your audience, mental rehearsal can be a powerful tool for you to use. This is what I had to do to become a Silva Method lecturer. At my level, I used to imagine speaking before a group of five people.

That was the biggest group I could imagine at that time. I imagined that I was presenting Silva Method techniques. Now, I already knew what to say, and how to say it.

I'd watched other lecturers do it, and I was doing it myself, although I was really nervous. I was working in graduate meetings, and my lecturer was even letting me precondition techniques in class. Well, I was so nervous with this, that at first, I simply used a mirror of the mind, because that was much less threatening than to imagine that I was actually up there.

I would just make mental movies of myself, giving the lecture, and the audience understanding, and appreciating, and being successful with the techniques. As I became comfortable with lecturing to five people, at my level, only in my imagination, then I picked a larger group. I imagined lecturing to a group of ten people.

Well, gradually, I began to imagine presenting Silva Method techniques to larger and larger groups, a little bit at a time. As I became more comfortable with the idea, I imagined that I was facing the audience. Not that I was watching a movie of myself facing an audience.

I became the speaker. I was out there looking into the faces of the audience. Now, during this time, I was getting up and talking to people, remember? Doing it in our graduate meetings, and even in class.

It was part of my training to become a Silva Method lecturer. Finally, one day, at my level, while I was mentally lecturing to a large group, about 50 people, as I recall, I realized that my attitude was all wrong. This came through at level.

Remember what Mr. Silva says, there's more information available to us at level. Alpha is the ideal place to analyze problems and come up with solutions. This is what happened.

I realized that when I was up there lecturing, I was always concerned about whether I'd said everything I was supposed to say. Whether I'd covered everything and done it correctly. This is not the right attitude for a speaker to have.

Not at all. You know what you should be thinking about? What I should have been thinking about? I should have been asking myself if the people in front of me knew what they needed to know in order to be successful with the techniques. Well, I changed my attitude immediately.

From that time on, I haven't focused on myself. `Because focusing on yourself and whether your performance is any good, that's what creates all the stress.` Instead, I focused on my audience and the needs of the audience that's out there in front of me.

I'm not up there to make myself look good. I could care less whether I look good or not. That's up to you to decide that.

I'm there to help the people who have come to the class. I'm here to help you learn how to use the Silva Method techniques. Use them successfully in your life so that you can get the benefits of them.

And I make a commitment to that. Just like I've told you, there's help there for you. Go to your local lecturer, wherever you need to.

If you can't get the help locally, which is always the best thing, get your help as close to home as possible. If you can't get the help that you need locally because there's no local lecturer or the lecturer is not there, perhaps on the road teaching somewhere and you need help right away, by all means, give me a call. As you can understand, I'm sure, we get a lot of calls here at headquarters because there's so many people out there.

I can't always get back to people as quickly as I'd like to, but I will be there to help you. If you want to be successful, I'll be there to help you. You know what? As long as I have that attitude, there's nothing to get nervous about.

I do the best I can, and hopefully you benefit, `but my performance is not the issue at all. It's your success.` If you have to get up and give a speech, you might want to go to level and think about some things like that first, and I'll bet you that it'll help you just as much as it helped me to learn how to relax and give better presentations.

Now, we also teach the mental rehearsal technique in the Silva Star Athlete Program that we started a number of years ago. It's an audio program to help athletes learn to practice mental rehearsal and play the mental game better. It's a wonderful way to improve physical skills and athletic performance.

If you're going to use it to improve your athletic performance, then before you even enter your level to program and to rehearse mentally, before that, first make strong points of reference about every aspect of the task as you perform it physically. Get your coach to help you. Get your coach to observe you and help you do it correctly, because when you rehearse mentally, you want to make sure you're doing it correctly.

You can actually go to the place where you practice and go through a practice session. Pay attention to how you feel as you go through each movement. Now, these suggestions come direct from Jose Silva.

He was a boxer when he was young. He learned how to box so he could defend himself here in Laredo, which is a border town, a western town, where you still need to know some self-defense skills to get along here, especially back in the 1920s when he learned this. So he learned to box, and he was good enough at it that he was able to box in clubs around South Texas.

He was a pretty good athlete. So pay attention to how you feel as you go through each movement. Make an impression of how it feels when you are just starting the movement, when you're one-fourth of the way through.

Make an impression of how it feels when you're halfway through, and again at three-quarters of the way, and again at the completion. Well, like what? Say you want to improve your golf swing, and this would apply to bowling or weightlifting, which is my sport, or whatever you're doing. If you want to improve your golf swing, first physically make an impression of exactly how it feels when you address the ball.

How are you balanced? How are you looking at it? Do you look with one eye predominant on the ball rather than the other, the left eye or the right eye? Exactly how do you feel as you address the ball? How does it feel when you start your backswing, when you're halfway through your backswing, at the top of your backswing? What's the position of your wrist, your elbows, your shoulders, your head, your eyes, your knees? Oh, golf is such a complex game when you come right down to it. Make these impressions throughout your swing as you're actually swinging the club. Do have your coach there with you.

Have somebody there, a golf pro there with you to make sure that you're doing it correctly and to correct any errors that you may be making. Once you've got it down completely and you know exactly what you're doing and exactly how it feels, then the mental rehearsal will be extremely effective for you. Now, repeat this same procedure for every movement, for chip shots, for putts, for getting out of sand traps, whatever you're doing.

Always start by making impressions of where you are now and where you want to go. Then at your level, you can imagine yourself correcting mistakes and improving your performance. If you have a tendency to slice the ball when you're playing golf, then you can go from the mistake that you're making, as pointed out by the golf pro, to the correction that's required and imagine yourself doing it and recall the feeling of doing it.

Keep making impressions as you go and making impressions at every step. Later, recall the feelings and you'll be there, feeling as though you have practiced, as though you've actually done the movements, even though you only did them at your level. Once you've made the impressions physically, then you can practice at any time you desire, even lying in bed.

By doing this, you know what? You can get all the benefits of practice but without fatiguing your body. Now, I knew a graduate one time who used this. He had gone out and started jogging.

However, he was getting shin splints. He could only jog a couple of times a week. Any more than that, he'd get shin splints, extreme soreness in his shins.

It had gotten so bad that for a time, he was having to tape his shins up, bandage them because they were so sore. It was the only way he could get around. He was in his late 30s.

He was told by trainers, by people with experience in the field, that they never knew of anybody at that age who had been able to get rid of shin splints if they had shin splints. Every time he'd go to level, he'd imagine running. He'd imagine himself out there running with no problem.

After about three months of this, he went out and started running again, and guess what? His legs got a little bit sore, he said, but he had no more problems with shin splints. He could run five times a week and not have shin splints. It's important to get your feelings involved whenever you're programming.

It's a very powerful thing. In order to make strong impressions on people, enter your level, and while at your level, review your performance and recall how you felt when you were successful. This will help you to be even more successful in the future.

Mr. Silva says there's a special feeling that comes with success, and the only way to get that feeling is to be successful, to have a success. Once you have a success, you have that feeling, go to your level, recall it, review it, impress it. Build a ladder to success by using your failures as rungs on the ladder.

Now we know a better way. Now that we understand more about how the brain works and how the mind works, we realize that in the mental dimension, like attracts like. We attract whatever it is that we're thinking about.

So when you go to level and recall that feeling of success and what you did and what it was like and how people responded to you and you can mix and match the techniques that you're learning in this course and find out what works best for you. You can always start with the mirror of the mind to program your desired end result. Then you can use mental rehearsal to help you achieve it.

For instance, if you're in sales, you can use the mirror of the mind to imagine yourself being recognized as salesperson of the year. Imagine your picture in a company newsletter that you've just discovered. Wouldn't that be exciting? Then you can use mental rehearsal to help you improve your selling skills.

You can mentally imagine yourself approaching a prospect, getting their attention, going through the process of showing them how your product or service will benefit them so that they'll want to buy it. You can use the memory pegs and the three fingers technique to help you remember the features and benefits of your product. Or help you be enthusiastic, whatever it is that you need.

Isn't that interesting? `The technique can be used to calm you down or pep you up`. Use it the way that you need to use it. You can use it to help you project a confident image when you're out there working or to remind you that your main goal is to help your customer and to be fairly compensated for doing so.

There are other techniques you can also use to help you in a project like that. Take your time. Manage your energy so that you'll be refreshed and ready and eager to help people and have the full ability to be able to help them.

There are also techniques that you can use to help you get information to help you do your job better, such as dream control or enter the alpha level and do your thinking at alpha. What would really help this person the most? How can I provide the greatest service to this person? How can I help this person to achieve greater success? Habit control is next. That'll help you get rid of bad habits.

It could be holding you back and especially help you create good habits that can help you reach your goals. It can make reaching your goals automatic. And the mental mentor will be the final new technique that we'll learn in this Choose Success course.

It's another technique that's not taught in the Basic Lecture Series. Your mental mentor can be there to encourage you whenever and wherever you need this. This next conditioning cycle is about 15 minutes long.

So when you're ready, program the mental rehearsal technique. Thank you.
