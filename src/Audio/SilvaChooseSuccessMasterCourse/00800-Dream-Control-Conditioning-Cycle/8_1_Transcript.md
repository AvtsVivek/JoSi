You are now at level one, the basic plane level that you are learning to use for a purpose, any purpose you desire. To help you enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, I'm going to count from ten to one. On each descending number you'll feel yourself going deeper and you will enter a deeper, healthier level of mind. 

Ten, nine, feel going deeper, eight, seven, six, deeper and deeper, five, four, three, deeper and deeper, two, one. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind, deeper than before. You may enter a deeper, healthier level of mind by simply relaxing your eyelids. 

Relax your eyelids, feel how relaxed they are. Allow this feeling of relaxation to flow slowly downward throughout your body, all the way down to your toes. It is a wonderful feeling to be deeply relaxed, a very healthy state of being. 

To help you enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, I'm going to count from one to three. At that moment you will project yourself mentally to your ideal place of relaxation. I will then stop talking to you and when you next hear my voice, one hour of time will have elapsed at this level of mind. 

My voice will not startle you, you will take a deep breath, relax and go deeper. One, two, three, project yourself mentally to your ideal place of relaxation until you hear my voice again. Relax, relax, take a deep breath and as you exhale, relax and go deeper. 

You will continue to listen to my voice. You will continue to follow the instructions at this level of the mind and any other level, including the outer conscious level. This is for your benefit. 

You desire it and it is so. Whenever you mentally or verbally mention the word relax, all unnecessary movements and activities of your body, brain and mind will cease immediately and you will become completely passive and relaxed, physically and mentally. I may bring you out of this level or a deeper level than this by counting to you from one to five.

At the count of five, your eyes will open, you will be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health. The difference between genius mentality and lay mentality is that geniuses use more of their minds and use them in a special manner. You are now learning to use more of your mind and to use it in a special manner. 

The following are beneficial statements that you may occasionally repeat while at these levels of the mind. Repeat mentally after me. My increasing mental faculties are for serving humanity better.

I will never learn to develop physically or mentally a dependence on drugs or alcohol. Negative thoughts and negative suggestions have no influence over me at any level of the mind. I will always maintain a perfectly healthy body and mind. 

Mental projection statements for success. I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to any problem area, so as to become aware of any abnormalities. If this is necessary and beneficial for humanity.

The second application will take care of a greater amount of the discomfort. Wait five more minutes, and apply the third application. With the third application, all of the discomfort will have disappeared. 

From then on, when symptoms appear, one application will take care of the migraine problem. As you continue to take care of this problem in this manner, the symptoms will appear less frequently until the body forgets how to cause them, bringing to an end the migraine problem without the use of drugs, and this is so. To correct health problems, controls are applied under a doctor's supervision. 

In your next session, we will program the location and use of the mental screen for visualization and imagination to faculties of genius, and for the development of superior clairvoyance. We will program a portion of a memory course for developing the use of the mental screen. Later, we will program the three-fingers technique and three of its applications for easier recall of information read, for easier recall of information heard, and in test-taking with the use of the three-cycle method, which includes ESP for obtaining higher grades. 

Every time you function at these levels of the mind, you will receive beneficial effect physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind to help yourself physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind to help your loved ones physically and mentally. 

You may use these levels of the mind to help any human being who needs help physically and mentally. You will never use these levels of the mind to harm any human being. If this be your intention, you will not be able to function within these levels of the mind.

You will always use these levels of the mind in a constructive, creative manner for all that is good, honest, pure, clean, and positive, and this is so. You will continue to strive to take part in constructive and creative activities to make this a better world to live in, so that when we move on we shall have left behind a better world for those who follow. You will consider the whole of humanity, depending on their ages, as fathers are mothers, brothers are sisters, sons are daughters.

You will have no ill effects whatsoever in your head, no headache, no ill effects whatsoever in your hearing, no buzzing in your ears, no ill effects whatsoever in your vision and eyesight.
