`This is the Mirror of the Mind conditioning exercise of the Silva Method.` Now prepare for this mind training exercise by finding a comfortable position. We will start this exercise with the 3 to 1 method.

Find a comfortable position, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number 3 three times.

Take another deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times.

You are now at level 1, the basic plane level that you are learning to use for a purpose, any purpose you desire. To help you enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, I'm going to count from 10 to 1. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going deeper, and you will enter a deeper, healthier level of mind. 10, 9, feel going deeper, 8, 7, 6, deeper and deeper, 5, 4, 3, deeper and deeper, 2, 1. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind, deeper than before.

You may enter a deeper, healthier level of mind by simply relaxing your eyelids. Relax your eyelids. Feel how relaxed they are.

Allow this feeling of relaxation to flow slowly downward throughout your body, all the way down to your toes. It is a wonderful feeling to be deeply relaxed, a very healthy state of being. To help you enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, I'm going to count from 1 to 3. At that moment, you will project yourself mentally to your ideal place of relaxation.

I will then stop talking to you. When you next hear my voice, one hour of time will have elapsed at this level of mind. My voice will not startle you.

You will take a deep breath, relax, and go deeper. 1, 2, 3. Project yourself mentally to your ideal place of relaxation until you hear my voice again. Relax.

Relax. Relax. Take a deep breath, and as you exhale, relax and go deeper.

You will continue to listen to my voice. You will continue to follow the instructions at this level of the mind and any other level, including the outer conscious level. This is for your benefit.

You desire it, and it is so. Whenever you mentally or verbally mention the word relax, all unnecessary movements and activities of your body, brain, and mind will cease immediately, and you will become completely passive and relaxed, physically and mentally. I may bring you out of this level or a deeper level than this by counting to you from 1 to 5. At the count of 5, your eyes will open.

You will be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health. The difference between genius mentality and lay mentality is that geniuses use more of their minds and use them in a special manner. You are now learning to use more of your mind and to use it in a special manner.

The following are beneficial statements that you may occasionally repeat while at these levels of the mind. Repeat mentally after me. My increasing mental faculties are for serving humanity better.

Every day in every way, I am getting better, better and better. Positive thoughts bring me benefits and advantages I desire. I have full control and complete dominion over my sensing faculties at this level of the mind and any other level, including the outer conscious level, and this is so.

The following statements are for your protection. This is mind control, your own self-mind control. You are always in control.

You may accept or reject anything I say, anytime, at any level of the mind. You are always in control. The following preventive statements are for your better health.

Keep in mind that from now on, I will occasionally be speaking in your place. I will never learn to develop, physically or mentally, mental disorders, nor psychosomatic or functional ailments or diseases. I will never learn to develop, physically or mentally, a dependence on drugs or alcohol.

Negative thoughts and negative suggestions have no influence over me at any level of the mind. I will always maintain a perfectly healthy body and mind. Mental projection statements for success.

I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties, and to project them to any problem area, so as to become aware of any abnormalities, if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. I am now learning to apply corrective measures and to correct any abnormality I detect. Negative thoughts and negative suggestions have no influence over me at any level of the mind.

We will now impress information for your benefit, programming the Mirror of the Mind, a formula-type technique that you can use for problem solving. Create and project on your mental screen a full-length mirror. This mirror will be known as the Mirror of the Mind.

This Mirror of the Mind can be mentally increased in size to encompass within its frame a thing or things, a person or persons, a small scene or a large scene. The color of the frame of the Mirror of the Mind can be mentally changed from blue to white. The blue frame will denote the problem or the existing situation which can be converted into a project.

The white frame will denote the solution or goal. To solve a problem or to reach a goal with the Mirror of the Mind, enter level 1 with the 3 to 1 method. Then project the image of the Mirror of the Mind with blue frame on your mental screen.

Create an image of the problem thing, person or scene and project it on your blue-framed Mirror of the Mind in order to make a good study of the problem. After making a good study of the problem, erase the problem image, move the mirror to your left, change the mirror's frame to white, and create and project a solution image onto the white-framed mirror. From then on, anytime you happen to think of the project, visualize the solution image you have created, framed in white.

And this is so. I will now allow time for you to work one problem case. Begin by applying your learned techniques.

When you hear my voice again, you will relax even more. In your next session, instead of using the 3 to 1 method to enter level 1, we will use the hand levitation method, which is a deepening technique. With the hand levitation method, you begin the session in a straight sitting position, looking at and concentrating on your stronger hand, while both hands rest on your lap.

While I count slowly from 10 to 1, you will go through a complete cycle of hand levitation to enter a deeper level of mind. During the time I am counting, you will cause your hand to feel very sensitive and cause any one finger of that hand to move. You will then cause your fingers to separate from one another and rise from your lap.

You will cause your whole hand and arm to rise from your lap. While I continue to count on a descending scale toward 1, you will continue to move your arm and hand very slowly toward your face until the back of your hand touches your face. When the back of your hand touches your face, you will close your eyes, take a deep breath, and while exhaling, you will bring your hand back to the rest position on your lap.

You will then be at a deeper, healthier level of mind. In your next session, we will program glove anesthesia, a formula-type technique that you can practice to develop control of physiological pain and, in many cases, control of bleeding and hemorrhaging. Glove anesthesia is the development of a feeling that is different from the normal and usually developed on the less strong of the two hands.

It could be a cool or cold feeling, or a feeling such as a tingling sensation, a vibration, as though your hand is asleep, as though you have a leather glove on your hand, as though your hand is made of wood, as though you have no hand. Any feeling other than the normal will be considered to be glove anesthesia. While you are at Level 1 in your next session, you will be asked to imagine placing your stronger hand in hot water and later your other hand in cold water to start the effect of glove anesthesia.

With practice, you can learn to develop the desired feeling of coldness that develops into insensibility or glove anesthesia. You will then learn, through practice, to transfer this feeling to other parts of your body. Every time you function at these levels of the mind, you will receive beneficial effects physically and mentally.

You may use these levels of the mind to help yourself physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind to help your loved ones physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind to help any human being who needs help physically and mentally.

You will never use these levels of the mind to harm any human being. If this be your intention, you will not be able to function within these levels of the mind. You will always use these levels of the mind in a constructive, creative manner, all that is good, honest, pure, clean and positive.

And this is so. You will continue to strive to take part in constructive and creative activities to make this a better world to live in, so that when we move on, we shall have left behind a better world for those who follow. You will consider the whole of humanity, depending on their ages, as fathers are mothers, brothers are sisters, sons are daughters.

You are a superior human being. You have greater understanding, compassion and patience with others. In a moment, I'm going to count from one to five.

At that moment, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. You will have no ill effects whatsoever in your head, no headache, no ill effects whatsoever in your hearing, no buzzing in your ears, no ill effects whatsoever in your vision and eyesight. Vision, eyesight and hearing improve every time you function at these levels of mind.

One. Two. Coming out slowly now.

Three. At the count of five, you will open your eyes, you'll be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before, feeling the way you feel when you have slept the right amount of revitalizing, refreshing, relaxing, healthy, wonderful sleep. Four.

Five. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. This concludes the Mirror of the Mind exercise for the Silva Method.

Thank you.
