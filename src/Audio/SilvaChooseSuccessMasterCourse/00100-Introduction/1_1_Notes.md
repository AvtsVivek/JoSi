## Notes

1. What are conditioning cycles. What we do in 1.mp3 and 2.mp3

2. What are `long relaxed cycle`, also called as `Silva Centering Exercise`. Is it differnt from conditioning cycles.

3. You need to have, a reason, a string desire. You should clearly know what those reasons are. And then you when go to deeper levels, you have to take those desires to those deeper levels. 
   1. These desires at those inner levels to help people to perform better, to accomplish more things for you and everybody.
   2. That feeling within you will express itself in what you say and how you say it

4. That lower level means, alpha level. 
   1. Both brain hemishers work, intution works, 
   2. The least impedance, the fewest impediments to the flow of energy is at the alpha level.

5. Super successful people when they need to analyze information, when they need to make a decision, they do their thinking at the alpha level. We can achieve an alpha level without falling asleep, become mentally active. They can do this at the alpha level without going back to beta. But nine out of ten people go back to beta as soon as they start doing their thinking. They do their thinking at the worst level for doing it and their action at the same level. The super successful people do their thinking at the alpha level, the best level for thinking, and then take action at beta. This is the correct way. Enter alpha levels with conscious awareness.

6. Theta level, is when you are knocked unconscious.
7. Below Theta level is when you are in deep sleep. Delta levels.
8. The Alpha exerciese in this session is a simple one. This one will be expanded in future sessions. 
   1. At the count down from 1 to 10, take a deep breadth and relax
   2. Relax eyelids, and let the relaxation flow through the entire body.
   3. At the cout from 1 to 3, project yourself mentally to your ideal place of relaxation.
   4. Some statements at the deep level of relaxatioin, and also what we will be doing in next exercises.
   5. At counting one to five, open eyes and feel refreshed.
   6.
