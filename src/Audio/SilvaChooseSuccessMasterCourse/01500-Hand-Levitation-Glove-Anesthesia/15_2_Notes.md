In this next mental exercise, you'll learn two new techniques. The first is a new way of entering level, an additional way from what you've already learned, and it allows you to enter a very, very deep level of mind also. The second technique is a first aid technique that you can use whenever you're hurt, whenever you have an injury, whenever you need to accelerate the healing process.

You have a couple of ways of knowing that you're really at your alpha level

Entering your level with hand levitation till `theta brainwave level`.


Your subconscious, which you have already converted into an inner conscious level, will cause your hand to rise at the direction of your imagination.

At theta, your subconscious will take over.

And it'll come up by the use of your imagination. 


`Biological intelligence is rooted at theta`. Human intelligence is rooted at alpha, 10 cycles. Biological intelligence of our body at `5 cycles theta`. `Psychological health problems are rooted at 10 cycles`.
