In your next session we'll be covering dream control and headache control techniques. Now dreams are like postcards from your subconscious. They can give you a lot of information about yourself, let you know how you think and about the things that you like and that you dislike. 

Some people have said that just this one feature of the Silva Method has provided them the greatest benefit that they've received from the course. What they've learned about themselves and remembering and understanding their dreams has proven very valuable to them. There are a lot of examples, let me give you just one. 

There was a young lady who took the course with me because she needed to pass the bar exam. She graduated from law school and she was having trouble passing the bar exam and she had to pass that if she was going to practice law. Well we worked, I even worked specially with her on the memory and test-taking techniques. 

Those techniques you'll learn a little bit later, but they didn't help her. It was pretty obvious that she knew the information. She was smart, she was well-educated, she was well-informed and we'd sit there and work it out together and we'd come up with the answers that she needed on the test. 

But when she'd go down to take the bar exam, somehow for some reason she wasn't getting the right answers. So it seemed obvious there was something else that was wrong. Well Mr. Silva says there's no such thing as a problem without a solution. 

Only problems for which we don't yet have enough information to know what the solution is. Dream control is an information technique, one to help us gather information so that we can make better decisions. So she programmed to have a dream to give her information to help her solve the problem. 

In her dream she dreamed about the fact that she was adopted. That's something she almost never thought about. She and her adoptive parents have so much love for each other that they usually forget the fact that she's adopted. 

They think of her as their natural daughter and she thinks of them as their natural parents. It really was a kind of a surprise to her when she had that dream and remembered consciously that she was adopted. Well what did that mean? Why did she have a dream like that? When she went to her level and analyzed the dream to figure out what it meant, then she began to recall the feelings that she'd had a long time ago about not being wanted by their natural parents. 

You know being thrown away, abandoned, those kind of feelings that some people who are adopted have. She began to remember what that felt like. Well she thought maybe could it be those those old feelings of unworthiness, those feelings of not being loved, of not being lovable. 

Could it be something that happened that long ago when she was just a very young girl? Could that stuff buried deep inside her be causing a problem for her now? Making her feel deep within that she was somebody who wasn't worthy of good things, who wasn't worthy of accomplishing lofty goals? Well she was able to deal with that. At her level she canceled out those feelings. She used the techniques like you'll be like the ones you'll be learning later such as mirror the mind to tell herself and let herself know that it wasn't because of her that she was adopted. 

It wasn't her fault. It wasn't her problem. She was able to get to a deep enough level to make some changes there and with that knowledge and with that programming she went back. 

She took the bar exam again. Guess what? She passed it with no trouble. In fact she has her own law practice now.

For about five years she worked for various government agencies. Everything from legal aid to the city attorney's office. But she really wanted her own practice. 

So she finally had enough courage and used the Silva techniques to help her. Started her own law practice. She uses the Silva method every day. 

By the way on a regular daily basis in her law practice to help her help her clients better. Even though she's still a pretty young attorney and there's an awful lot she doesn't know and she knows there's a lot she doesn't know. She works so hard for her clients and using the Silva method that she's turned out probably in many instances helps her clients more than any other attorney in town would do so. 

Here's another story. A different kind of a story this time. This was a man I'll call Tom. 

He attended the Basic Lecture Series with me in Albuquerque, New Mexico a few years back. He had a fabulous experience with the dream control technique and this experience may have saved him tens of thousands of dollars. Tom was a very successful developer. 

He put in a lifetime in that business. Put together many projects over the past 20 or 30 years and earned a lot of money by developing housing projects and subdivisions and commercial properties. Well Tom was a bit skeptical of this young guy coming in to teach him how to use his mind better. 

He wasn't too sure he should trust us at all. He kind of was curious about the course but still skeptical. So I made a deal with him. 

I told him to come on in on Saturday morning and start the class to go ahead and give me a check. Money was not a problem for him. So I told him give me a check and I'd put it in my pocket. 

He could keep his eye on me. He could watch me for the whole weekend. The banks weren't even open on weekends back in those days. 

So I told him just watch me. I'll have the check here anytime you want to leave. I told him I'll give you back a check and you can go. 

You know I won't even deposit it until you tell me to deposit it Tom. So at the end of the weekend I asked him what he wanted to do. If he wanted to take his money or if he was coming back or what. 

He told me to hold on to the check and he'd come back the next weekend and see how that went. After the first weekend he programmed the dream control technique. He was somebody who remembered dreams. 

So he went right to the third step and programmed to have a dream to help him decide what to do about a new project that he was just entering into. He had a dream. He was a little concerned but he didn't know why.

He couldn't find anything wrong with the project. He just wanted to make sure. So he went ahead and said let me try this Silva technique. 

He had a dream about an old boyhood friend of his. A young fellow that he had grown up with. They'd gone through school together. 

They went to college together. They even went into business together after college. He hadn't thought about his friend in over 20 years. 

So he began to wonder why would I dream about him now. Then he remembered oh yeah the business arrangement that we had it didn't work out too well. He didn't give us details but he did tell us that there were some things there that went wrong and it cost him some money and it basically cost him that friendship. 

Well as he thought back on those experiences with his former friend began to recall some of the details of their business dealings and he suddenly realized that there were many similarities between the business transactions of all those years ago and the current project that he was considering going forward with. I haven't decided to call off the deal yet Tom told us but I have made a list of questions to ask and several things that I'm going to check out before I go ahead with this project. He told us that doing this could save him a great deal of money. 

He also told me to go ahead and deposit his check that he'd gotten his money's worth and a whole lot more just by finding an additional way to draw on his past experiences to help him make better business decisions today. He now had enough information that he had the options that he could choose whether to go ahead with the project or not. He could choose success or avoid failure because he had more information to work with. 

`Dreams are wonderful communications tools to help you get information and make decisions` so that when you do your programming you'll know that you're right. There'll be no doubt. It's important when you're doing your programming to remove all doubts. 

These communications tools are essential to doing that. You can use the information in your dreams to help you manage your life better just as the attorney did and you can use the information in dreams to guide you in your programming using the techniques that you're learning in the Silva Method Choose Success course. Dreams can provide a wide variety of information, many types of information. 

It can provide information that's stored in your memory banks as in the two examples that we've just talked about. Dreams can go way beyond that. Your mind, while you're sleeping, your mind can go out and search out information wherever that information may be on other people's brain cells, other people's memory banks, from past experience that have happened on this planet. 

It can get information from higher intelligence on the other side to show us how to proceed. Anywhere that information happens to be, your mind can get it and can deliver it to you in a dream. Your mind never sleeps, so if you give it instructions to find information that you can use to solve a problem, it'll do so. 

Now we're telling you this and including it here in the home study course because it's such a natural phenomenon. Have you ever had a precognitive dream? You know, you dreamed about something and then the next day or a few days later it happened? Many people have. Have you ever had a dream that contained information that helped you to understand a situation, helped you to solve a problem? Many people have had that kind of dream too. 

In fact, I started asking this question of people who attend our free introductory lectures, people who haven't been through the Sova Method training. And if we just pause and let them think about it, let them look around and see how many other people are raising their hands. As many as two-thirds of the people who are sitting out there in the introductory lecture will answer yes to at least one of those two questions.

They've had dreams that let them know about things that were going to happen or they gave them information that they could use to solve problems. It's a very common experience. So with a little bit of luck, you'll be able to get this working for you in this manner even without attending the basic lecture series. 

So many people have already done it. If you don't get that kind of information, clairvoyant type information, then do attend the basic lecture series with an instructor who is accustomed to getting information this way. Your instructor's mind then will guide your mind to know exactly what to do to be able to function in this manner. 

There's a lot of evidence for mind-to-mind communication in dreams. There's a fascinating book titled Dream Telepathy written by a researcher named Stanley Krippner. Krippner's a specialist in this area. 

He was the first one to prove that mental projection exists. What he did was this. He would take subjects that worked best with subjects who were friends and had good rapport with each other because they were not trained specifically to do this like you're learning here. 

He would take subjects who were friends with each other. One of them he put in one laboratory and let them go to sleep. He would wire them up with the electrodes and everything before they go to sleep so they could tell what level they were at, what phase of sleep they were at. 

Their friend then would be in another room and there would be a hundred envelopes, sealed envelopes there. When the sleeping subject was in a dream state, they would ask the other subject who was awake to take one of the envelopes at random, open it up, and pull out the picture that was inside. Then to look at that picture and try to mentally communicate that picture to their friend who was asleep. 

Then they would wake up their friend who was asleep. Now they learned how to wake them up at the right time. They wake them up at the very beginning of a dream, then there's nothing to remember. 

If they wake them up halfway through, it's a confused dream, you know, like opening a book in the middle. They don't know what to make of it. When they wake them up at the end of the dream cycle, then they could talk about the dream that they were having. 

Later on, they took the dream stories that were told by the subjects who'd been sleeping, and the pictures, the hundred different pictures that had been used in the experiment, and they would give them to someone else and say, do any of these stories relate to any of these pictures? And very often they would get a significant number of hits where the stories and the pictures would correlate. The dream that the person was having was something that could take place within the picture. So they did demonstrate mental projection could take place, especially during dream times. 

It's a fascinating book if you want to look at it. Well, here's a formula for remembering dreams. Let's get right into it here. 

Again, this is a formula type technique. Follow it through. Do it the way. 

There's three steps involved. The first step is to practice remembering a dream. Many people don't remember the dreams at all.

So you want to practice just remembering a dream each night. So when you're ready to go to sleep, you're in your bed, ready to go to sleep, enter level one with the three-to-one method. Once at level one, you will mentally tell yourself, I want to remember a dream, and I'm going to remember a dream. 

You will then stay at level one and go to sleep from level one. You will awaken during the night or in the morning with a vivid recollection of a dream. Now have paper and pencil ready to write it down. 

If you don't write it down, you'll probably just go back to sleep and you wake up in the morning and you won't recall it. So write it down. Transfer it to the physical dimension. 

We've had people sometimes come back and say, this didn't work and I still don't remember dreams. We find out they didn't have their pencil and paper ready to write it down. Their mind didn't take them seriously. 

So if you're serious about it, what are your reasons for wanting to learn this? When you program the technique, have your reasons. What's your purpose in doing this? That'll boost your desire and that'll make the technique work very quickly for you. Now when you're satisfied that dream control step one is responding, then start with dream control step two. 

Dream control step two is very much like one. You say you enter level one with the three-to-one method. Once at level one, you mentally tell yourself, I want to remember my dreams and I'm going to remember my dreams. 

Plural. Then stay at level one. Go to sleep from level one. 

You will awaken several times during the night and in the morning with vivid recollections of dreams. Have paper and pencil ready to write them down. You know this sounds like, gee, what am I doing? Am I going to get any sleep at night? This is very natural. 

Remember we talked about the sleep and dream cycles that we go through? You come up to a high beta, I mean a high alpha, excuse me, maybe even into a low beta to have the dream. So when you wake up right at the end of the dream, spend a few seconds, a half a minute or so, a minute maybe, writing down what it is. Then you go right back to sleep, right back into your next sleep and dream cycle. 

It really doesn't disrupt your sleep at all. Then in the morning when you get up, you check your list there, you see what the dreams were, you enter your level and you analyze the dreams at your level. How do you go about interpreting dreams? Well, I'll tell you how not to do it. 

Don't go down to the grocery store and pick up one of those little cheap books that says, here's what all the dream symbols mean. Dream symbols are individual for each person. You need to figure out what symbols mean for you. 

An elephant may mean one thing to you, something else to another person. So by looking at your dream, studying the dreams that you had, reflecting on them at level, thinking about what did I do yesterday that could relate to this dream. Do something like that. 

You'll begin to understand what they mean. There's a lady named Anne Faraday, wrote a book called The Dream Game. She's a Silva Method graduate. 

That's an excellent book to help you learn how to interpret dreams and to keep dream diaries and dream logs and use dreams to help you with information that you can use to solve problems. She talks about certain themes that take place in dreams. There are certain themes that can be a guideline, but the specific symbolism that's there is something that you need to determine for yourself at your level exactly what it means for you. 

Now after Dream Control Step 2 is responding, then you can start with Dream Control Step 3. Dream Control Step 3, you practice generating a dream that you can remember, understand, and use for problem-solving. You will enter level 1 with the 3 to 1 method. Once at level 1, you'll mentally tell yourself, I want to have a dream that will contain information to solve the problem I have in mind. 

You state the problem and then add, I will have such a dream, remember it, and understand it. Then you'll go to sleep from level 1. Now you may awaken during the night with a vivid recollection of the desired dream, or you may awaken in the morning with a vivid recollection of such a dream. You will have this dream, remember it, and understand it. 

Now do remember, develop steps 1 and 2. Before you can remember several dreams at night, just practice remembering a dream each night. If you're already doing that, remember dreams each night. Write them down, get to know them. 

When you're able to remember dreams every night, several dreams every night, then you've gained enough control of the dream process, the sleep and dream process, that you can send your mind out looking for information, scanning your memory banks looking for information, and perhaps even bringing back clairvoyant information to you as well. Now also in this conditioning, we'll include a formula for headache control to relieve tension and migraine type headaches without the use of drugs. One note here, whenever you're working on health problems, work under a doctor's supervision. 

This is not a substitute for competent medical care. This is not a way to cure a medical problem, but this is a supplement to it. Now the headache control follows the same general format as the awake control technique that you learned in the previous conditioning cycle. 

First you identify the problem, then your goal, make a plan, work your plan, and then claim that reward. Here's how it goes. If you have a tension type headache, enter level 1 with the 3 to 1 method.

Once at level 1, mentally tell yourself, I have a headache. I feel a headache. I don't want to have a headache. 

I don't want to feel a headache. I'm going to count from 1 to 5. At the count of 5, I will open my eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health. I will then have no headache. 

I will then feel no headache. Then you will slowly count from 1 to 2, then to 3. At the count of 3, you will remind yourself mentally that at the count of 5, I will open my eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health. I will then have no discomfort in my head. 

I will then feel no discomfort in my head. Notice that we've made a change at level 3 from ache to discomfort. We left the ache behind. 

You will then proceed to mentally count slowly to 4, then to 5. And at the count of 5, and with your eyes open, you will say to yourself mentally, I am wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health. I have no discomfort in my head. I feel no discomfort in my head. 

And this is so. At that time, remember you've got to make it work for you. It's up to you to make it work for you. 

The formula doesn't do it all by itself. You've got to be an active participant in it. I learned that the hard way. 

I used to use the headache control technique. I'd go through it, I'd get to the count of 5, and I'd finish. And the first thing I'd do is check to see if the headache was gone. 

Well, guess what? I was looking for the headache. And guess what I found? The headache was still there. So I'd go ahead and start going about my business, and then the headache would go away. 

So what you do, when you reach the count of 5, you finish it up, you finish the formula, you open your eyes, you do all of that. Then at that point, take it for granted, the headache's gone. Even if you still feel something there. 

Hey, just tell yourself that you don't. Make it happen. These are tools that we use to correct problems. 

Now, if you have migraine headaches, you do the same formula. Go through the same formula, but go through it three different times, five minutes apart. Go through it one time. 

The first application, go through it. That will take care of part of the discomfort. Wait five minutes. 

Again, follow these instructions exactly. Make it five minutes. Then enter your level again. 

Go through the same formula again. The second application will take care of a greater amount of the discomfort. Then wait five minutes. 

Enter your level again. The third application will take care of the remainder of the discomfort. From then on, when symptoms appear, one application will take care of the migraine problem. 

You know, they say that a migraine is preceded by kind of an aura. Migraine sufferers can tell when one's coming. As soon as you sense that, immediately, immediately go to your level.

Go through the formula. Do not let it happen. Do not blow up into a migraine headache. 

You may say, oh, how can I do that? I'm working in the office. I'm at my desk. I can't sit there with my eyes closed going through this formula. 

People think I'm sleeping on the job. Well, let me tell you, there's a way to do it. You see, there is a room. 

There's a special room in just about every building you ever go into that is designed for going to level, for relaxing, and for meditation. It's called a restroom. Okay, go to the restroom. 

Go to the bathroom. Get in there. Go to your level and take care of it. 

People don't bother you when you're in there most of the time. So that gives you a chance to deal with the headache. There was a man I knew in Titusville, Florida, who'd had migraines for 20 years. 

He came to one of our graduate meetings one time. He told us how he had used the technique and eliminated the migraines. He had thrown away his medication. 

It was no problem. He worked out at the Kennedy Space Center in the missile program. Well, then one day, he said he felt a migraine coming on. 

He tried to think it away. He was busy. He was at his desk. 

He couldn't really go to his level there. He didn't know about going to the restroom. So he sat there, and he tried to think it away, and it didn't work, and he wound up with a full-blown migraine and had to go down to the hospital and get some medication for it.

So he learned the hard way that whenever you sense it, take care of it immediately. What happens is, as you continue to take care of the problem in this manner, your body forgets how to cause the headaches, and it brings the migraine problem to an end. Now, some people come back and say, it looks like all we're doing is treating the symptoms, Ed. 

How is it we're just treating the symptoms? What do you mean it brings the problem to an end? I asked Mr. Silva about that once. Here was his answer. He said that when you enter level yourself, not somebody else taking it to level, when you enter level on your own, and you apply the whatever is necessary to correct the cause of the problem. 

Isn't that wonderful? Your mind will work for you without your even knowing what's going on. We don't find the stress and the tension expressing itself in another way. We find that we're correcting whatever is causing the stress and the tension in the first place. 

Perhaps it's a change in our attitude. Perhaps it's a change in reactions. Whatever it may be, your mind will find ways to correct it. 

Now, do remember, dealing with a health problem, apply controls under a doctor's supervision. If there's an organic reason for the headache, sometimes it's that, then you definitely need to get that taken care of. This is simply a pain control technique in that case. 

Okay? Remember the value of spending 15 minutes at level every single day if you have a health problem. Now, you notice the headache control uses the same five steps as the awake control, and as we get into other techniques later using visualization, you'll find that we still always start by identifying the problem, the solution, making a plan, working the plan, and then making those results appear for us. You can use this same approach to help you with your dreams. 

Scientists report that everybody dreams, although we know that some people don't remember their dreams or don't recall them. Maybe they had nightmares when they were young and just stopped remembering the dreams. Well, if you have dreams that you don't want to have, bad dreams or nightmares, you can use your level to correct this. 

Use the same steps. Before you go to sleep, enter your level. State the problem, that you're having bad dreams, and the solution. 

From now on, you want to have good dreams. Make a plan. From now on, whenever I get in bed, ready to go to sleep, I'll enter my level, and I will go to sleep from level, and I will be thinking good thoughts as I go to sleep, and I will have only good dreams, dreams that help me, dreams that are beneficial for me. 

And this will be so. And then go to sleep, and have those good dreams, and get the benefits of those dreams. It's really wonderful to be able to have techniques like this that we can use to correct problems. 

Mr. Silva helped correct a problem that his children encountered one time. It happened when they took a vacation down to Mexico. Jose and Paula Silva wanted to go out, so they got a babysitter to stay with the children. 

Well, the babysitter wanted to go ahead and get the kids into bed, so she could sit and watch television, but the kids were all excited about being on the trip, so they weren't too inclined to go to bed. So the babysitter came up with a plan. She says, you go to bed right now, and if you get out of bed, a monster is going to get you. 

So then she went, and she scratched on the wall, made a scratching sound on the wall, and says, hear the monster. The monster is going to get you if you don't stay in bed. Well, this solved the babysitter's problem. 

Okay, the kids got in bed and stayed in bed. But then when Mr. and Mrs. Silva returned, they found that the children had a problem, a much bigger problem. They were afraid now to get out of bed. 

If they needed to go to the bathroom, or wanted to get a drink of water, they were afraid. They were almost afraid to close their eyes and go to sleep, because that monster was there waiting for them. Well, now the point is, in the children's minds, and in their imagination, that monster existed. 

It was only in their imagination, but imagination is very real. Remember, everything begins with the mind. And children are so creative and so imaginative that they believe that there was a monster there.

So it wouldn't do any good to tell them, oh, there's no monster. You don't have to worry about that. So what Mr. Silva did instead, he did this. 

He said, look, point your finger, and he showed them how to take their forefinger and point it. Says, now take this, and whenever you see the monster, whenever that monster is there, you shake your finger at that monster, and shake your finger, and shake your finger. And every time you shake your finger at that monster, it's going to get smaller, and smaller, and smaller. 

He told them that finger that he had given it a lot of power, and that that's the way you took care of a monster. So they're out there just shaking their finger at the monster, so they get smaller, and smaller, and smaller, until after a while, it's so small that it's not scary. It's just like a little toy. 

While he couldn't tell them that it didn't exist, because in the subjective dimension with their imagination, they had created an image of a monster, and that image of that monster did exist. There was no monster, of course. But they imagined it so vividly that it frightened them. 

So he simply showed them how to alter it, and take care of the problem. So you've got very, very powerful techniques here that you can use to correct any problem that you need to. Now this conditioning cycle contains all of the standard material. 

You enter your level with the three-to-one method. We have all the deepening, the various rapport statements, and beneficial statements, and so on. So make yourself comfortable. 

You can use any position that's comfortable for you. You can continue sitting if you want to, like we asked you to do for the relaxation to get started with it. Or now that you've mastered the ability to get to deep levels of mind, and deep states of relaxation, now go ahead and use whatever position you like to that you're comfortable with. 

If you're comfortable stretching out on a sofa, lying down somewhere, go ahead and do that so long as you don't fall asleep. Remember, we want to do this with conscious awareness. If you find yourself drifting off, losing consciousness, losing awareness, going to sleep, if you find yourself doing that, then make yourself a little less comfortable. 

Otherwise, make yourself as comfortable as you want to be. Later, as you get more practice, then remember to practice going to level in various positions, and in various kinds of situations. You want to be able to go to level anytime that you need to, not to have some special place in some special position or anything like that. 

You'll even learn with practice how to go to level standing up with eyes open when you need to. We'll cover that later. For now, we'll get the basics. 

So make yourself comfortable. Make sure you have plenty of time. The conditioning is about 19 minutes long. 

So when you're ready, and you have the time, find a place where you can relax and not be disturbed, and go to level, and we'll program and impress the dream control and headache control techniques. Thank you.
