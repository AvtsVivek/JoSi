Habits can be your best friend or your worst enemy. Let's talk about habits, what they are, how they work, what gives them their power, and how you can choose to change them to eliminate bad habits that may be holding you back and start good new habits that can help you make choosing success automatic. Habits are patterns of behavior that are repeated over and over and over and over and over again until they become automatic.

It's easier to do them than not to do them. In other words, once you get used to doing something, any effort to change and do something else is threatening, is stressful. If you're accustomed to failing, the prospect of succeeding can be threatening, can be stressful.

So stressful that you find a way to fail. In fact, a few years back, people started writing books about the fear of success. The good news is, once you understand this, you can use the extra energy that's generated through that stress, that fear of whatever it may be, the fear of change, you can use that energy to your advantage and turn fear into victory.

Let's see how it works. Habits are powerful because they build on a natural human trait, the apprehension that's triggered anytime we encounter something new or something different in our environment. Or to put it more simply, fear of the unknown.

This apprehension creates energy that you can use to help you achieve your goals. Or it can create fear that can cause you to crawl in a hole and hide. It can create so much fear that it causes illness in people from stress.

Well, the choice is yours. You can let this fear and this energy take over you and take over your life, or you can use it to help you achieve greater success. Back before recorded history, back in a time when our ancestors had to survive in the jungle without tools, without weapons, living by their wits, they developed very strong survival mechanisms.

You know, human beings aren't well-equipped to fight in the jungle. We don't have fangs and claws and things like that. Well, imagine walking through the jungle.

You're hungry, and you hear a rustling in the bushes nearby. Now, you're pretty hungry. That noise could mean that there's a small animal over there, a little rabbit or a bird or something, that maybe you could catch it and eat it and survive for another day, satisfy your hunger.

On the other hand, it could be a large animal, a tiger, that maybe wants to catch you and eat you so that it can survive for another day. It's all a matter of survival. Catch the rabbit, eat it, and you'll survive longer.

Outrun the tiger, and you'll survive. Either way, our ancestors needed a big burst of energy. The people whose bodies could generate the most energy quickly in an emergency were the people who survived.

They were able to run, to flee, or to stay and fight, thus the flight or fight response. Now, their descendants, that includes you and me, we inherited the characteristics of our ancestors, including the ability to create a lot of energy when something happens that we're not expecting, something new. That's one reason that habits are so powerful.

Habits are so familiar with that we're comfortable with them. We know there's nothing unknown about our habits. Now, there are many habits that are very helpful to us.

You may not even notice which leg you put into your pants first when you put your jeans on or how you tie your shoelaces. Try to do that consciously sometime. These are things that we do automatically by habit, and it makes life a lot easier for us.

But some of our other habits are not so good for us. All too often, people embrace habits that relate in some way to the survival mechanism and then use these habits to ease and reduce the stress, the feelings of apprehension, the fear that we experience as we go through our day-to-day lives. Well, now, what are the greatest survival needs that we have? What do we need to survive? We need food, at least some food, once every few weeks.

Yeah, there are people who fast for 30 days as a religious exercise or something. So you can do that. We need water more often than that.

We need water maybe every few days. In some climates, like here in Laredo, every day. And we need air every few minutes, even a few minutes without air, and we don't make it.

Now, look at some of the most common bad habits and destructive habits that people have that people very often want to change. When we feel threatened, we have a tendency to seek out something to reassure us that we can continue to survive. So what do we put into our bodies? Food, liquids, air.

We need to reassure ourselves that we have something to eat, we have something to drink, and that we're breathing. So look at how many people eat when they're under stress. Oh, and you know the best foods to eat when you're under stress, don't you? The ones that ease the stress the most are the high-calorie foods, the ones with a lot of sugars and a lot of fats, the ones that add the most weight, have little or no nutritional value.

So people keep going on diets, and that's not easy to do either. It's an unnatural act, isn't it, to go on a diet and not eat when you want the food? Some people use liquids when they're under stress. They find liquids to drink.

Well, now, what kind of liquids are they going to drink? Sometimes soda pop, sweet things. Often it's intoxicating liquids, because there you get an extra side benefit from those to deal with the stress even more. You begin to relax.

You begin to lose touch with reality. So therefore, it's easier to cope with the stress. Sometimes they cope with it so well that they wind up in an alcoholic stupor where they have no recollection of anything else that's going on or whatever's causing the stress or what's happening during the day.

They don't even remember. Some people seem to have such a great need for reassurance that they're alive, that they ingest smoke in their lungs. They can now feel themselves breathing.

When they breathe out, they can actually see their breath. Oh, boy. Now, is that powerful.

No wonder smokers get so upset if somebody suggests to them that they stop smoking. That's not only the nicotine addiction, which they say is one of the most powerful drugs around. They are saying now that it's more addictive than cocaine.

So not only is it the physical addiction, but it's also the idea of, what are you saying, that I don't have a right to live? Is this what you're trying to tell me? Well, maybe now we see why they're so upset. That's not what we're saying, of course. Well, what can we do to get rid of bad habits and create good new habits? Let's talk about them.

Let's talk first about getting rid of some of the bad habits. Jose Silva has developed strategies to help you make the changes a little at a time. Small changes are usually easier to make than big ones.

Or we have strategies, in addition to that, to change mentally first, and then the physical change will follow and be automatic. Let me give you some specific examples. Anytime you want to change a habit, you want to eliminate a bad habit, start a good habit, the first step is always what? Considering the course you're taking, you should be able to answer that question now.

The first step is to enter your level, and at your level, at alpha, analyze the problem. Alpha is the best place for analysis, the place where there are the fewest impediments to our thought processes, so that you can get a much more clear idea of what's going on, what the problem is, and what you need to do. Well, you could do this.

Let's say the problem is cigarette smoking, and you could do this for other types of habits as well. Enter your level, and analyze the situation, and determine when you smoke the first cigarette of the day. Is it when you first wake up, with your first cup of coffee, while you're on the way to work? When's the first time you smoke a cigarette? When the phone rings? Whenever that is, program yourself at your level to smoke that first cigarette one hour later.

Just make a little change, one hour later. You're not depriving yourself of the cigarette, you're just changing the habit a little bit. What you're doing, in effect, is developing a new habit, by smoking the first cigarette an hour later.

It's much easier to break a new habit than an old one. An old one is so familiar that it can be very difficult to part with. It's like a long-time love affair.

Breaking up is hard to do. So do it little by little. After that becomes comfortable to you, to smoke the first one one hour later, then make it one hour later than that, and one hour later than that.

Keep making those changes, until eventually it'll be easy to stop smoking altogether. You can do other things. You can smoke different brands of cigarettes, for instance.

Cigarettes that you don't particularly like. Here's a technique that Mr. Silva came up with that is so powerful. It has not only helped cigarette smokers and drinkers, it's even helped heroin addicts.

I've personally met four people who were heroin addicts who were stoned when they went through the course. I'm talking about people who would go into the restrooms during the breaks and mainline heroin. In fact, two of those people became instructors.

One of them went on to win our top award, the President's Cup, as a top instructor, and he even talks about it in his classes and in his introductory lectures. How'd they get off of heroin? They got off of it 30 days, within 30 days, by using this technique. Here's how they did it.

First of all, mark a date on a calendar, 30 days in the present. Then enter your level and tell yourself mentally that on this date you will stop smoking and will never smoke again in your life. Enter your level every day and reinforce this programming.

When the 30 days are up, you will not want to smoke anymore. Now, why is this? Because you are changing the habit mentally. You are mentally taking possession of what you want.

You are choosing at your level what you desire. Now, anybody can put something off for a month, right? We put it off for a month, but at the same time, you are taking action every single day to change that habit. And it works.

You can create new habits in the same manner. Do them gradually. If you want to get in the habit of going to level every morning when you first wake up, in the beginning you might have to remind yourself to do it.

You might have to rearrange your schedule a bit in order to do it. Make it easy on yourself by going to level for just 5 minutes. When this becomes effective, then begin staying at level for 10 minutes.

When this is easy and natural, increase to the recommended 15 minutes. You know, when you do something every single day, you condition yourself to do it every day. You make it a habit.

So, pay attention to the habits you create. Make sure all your new habits are good habits. You can do them mentally with the 30-day programming technique.

You want to start a new habit? Program yourself at your level the 30 days from this date. That will be your routine way of functioning. What are the habits that successful people have? You know, you can start studying successful people, the people that you admire, that you would like to be like.

What do they do? What are their regular habits? Do they get up earlier in the morning so they can get work done before other people start calling on them and interrupting them? Do they go to the office earlier? Do they have the habit of handling every phone call personally as soon as it comes in, never putting anything off? Maybe the habit of calling on clients or business associates on a regular basis. They maybe set aside 15 minutes every day for service calls like that. Many successful people, many successful executives exercise on a regular basis because they know that in order to do the amount of work that they have to do to achieve the level of success that they desire, they may be working 80, 90, 100 hours a week.

For that, they need a strong, healthy, and fit body. They need to be able to think clearly and fatigue interferes with that, just as alcohol, nicotine, and so many other things do. Whatever habits they have, you can develop those habits.

Make the changes. Start these new habits on the inside first. Program them at your level.

Do them every day. It's easy to do them every day at your level. There's no stress involved.

There's no stress when you imagine calling people on the phone. And after you get used to doing it at your level, you'll find that it will be easy to do it objectively, physically as well. If heroin addicts can program like that to eliminate the heroin addiction, you can do anything.

Now, one word of caution about all this. You cannot change habits with willpower. Whenever willpower and imagination are in conflict, imagination always wins out.

I want to take an example, show you exactly what we're talking about. Suppose you're determined that you're going to eat better, to eat more nutritious food, to reduce your weight, to get in shape, to stay healthy and have plenty of energy, all the energy that you need to do the work that you want to do. As always, it's your choice to do this or not.

Suppose you choose to do this. Okay? You go out to lunch with a group of friends. They all order big meals, right? The big steak with the sauce all over it and the potato with all the sour cream in it.

You know the routine. But you only order the chef's salad. That'll be sufficient for you.

That'll be what you need. That's the appropriate thing. And you order the dressing on the side so that you can dip the salad in the dressing and not need nearly as much of the dressing, which contains all the high-calorie oil and so forth.

Everything goes well. They're eating, you're eating. You're satisfied.

You're chewing your food thoroughly. You're really enjoying it. Everything's great until time for dessert.

No thanks, none for me. But your friends at the table, what do they do? They order the cakes, the pies, the ice cream, the big chocolate... Oh, here's one of your friends sitting right next to you. And the waitress comes out and passes right in front of your nose to your friend this great, big, beautiful chocolate sundae.

You know, with the cold ice cream, the hot chocolate fudge melting on the top of it, the nuts all over it, the cherry, the whipped cream. Oh, that looks so good. But you say, no, I'm not having that.

I have willpower, and I'm not going to have that. But it looks so good. It smells so good.

You imagine the taste of it. Wouldn't that taste so... And guess what? Excuse me, would you bring me one of those, too? Imagination will always win out. Well, the good news is, you know, you can use your imagination to increase your willpower.

At your level, program for what you desire. Get your imagination and your willpower working together. What is it you desire? Good health, that feeling of a lot of energy, a slim, sleek, sexy body.

What is it that you are looking for? Program that at your level over and over. Then when the big chocolate yuck comes out, the big chocolate sundae, and you look at that, visualize the solution image you have created in your white-framed mirror of the mind, which is that sleek, sexy, healthy, fit, energized body. Imagine how good you feel all day, every day.

This is much more valuable to you than a few minutes of taste in your mouth, isn't it? Get your imagination working for you instead of against you. Remember how we stated at the beginning of this Choose Success course that it's so important to have a purpose, that you have reasons for doing what you're doing. At your level, review your reasons for wanting to change your eating habits or to exercise more regularly or to stop smoking or drinking.

Whatever habit you want to change, any habit you want to stop, any habit you want to start, at your level, review the reasons that you have for wanting to do this. If you don't have any good reasons for yourself, what about your family? Do you want your children to imitate you to smoke or drink or lose their temper or get into trouble? Or do you want them to be better than that? Reprogram. Make new habits for yourself for the sake of your loved ones.

Well, you get the idea. Do you want to take a chance of having a heart attack and having your family have to go on without you? This could be enough motivation for you to do whatever is necessary for you to change your habits. Mr. Silva suggests that when we're programming for someone else to change their habits, not to program for them to change their habits, program for them to have a desire to change their habits.

Desire is so powerful. When they have a strong enough desire to make a change, they'll make the change. When you have a strong enough desire to change your life, to choose success, then you will do whatever is necessary to choose success.

Sometimes you might find it better to change only the part of the habit that causes the actual harm if you're dealing with a bad habit. That may be as far as you can go at that time. Mr. Silva suggests that if you're so accustomed to handling cigarettes with your hands, holding them between your lips, all the little activities of opening up the package, getting out a match or a lighter, asking someone else for a light, all those things that are associated with cigarette smoking, then go ahead and do those things, but then don't inhale the cigarette smoke.

Drinkers can do the same thing by drinking non-alcoholic beer or wine. First, it may taste a little different, but before long you'll grow accustomed to it. How do I know? That's what I do.

I used to drink a little beer. Well, all right. I used to drink a lot of beer.

Like half a case a night, minimum. Well, now I have no desire to drink any alcoholic beverages at all. In fact, I can't even imagine why I would want to impair my senses in the slightest.

I'm enjoying life too much. I have something a lot better than alcohol now. I have alpha.

And no, practicing alpha every day, three, four, five times a day, will not make you an alphaholic. But I did drink so much beer for so long. At the age of 30, I was drinking at least half a case of beer every night.

I drank so much that after I stopped drinking it, I felt strange in many situations. I wanted to have a glass in my hand of something cold. I wanted to feel cold liquid going down my throat.

I'd be with friends, and they might be drinking something. I didn't want to, but I wanted to go through the motions of it. Watching a football game.

I used to do that and drink beer. Then all of a sudden, I had to watch football games without drinking anything. Well, I found substitutes.

I found other things that I could drink. And now that the non-alcoholic beers have become so popular, that's an easy way to do it. Drosilva suggests using a glass of tomato juice spiked with a liberal amount of hot pepper sauce whenever you have an urge to drink.

Well, if you're going to do that, be sure you check with your doctor and make sure that it's safe for you to use the hot sauce. As Drosilva says, this is a good way to work on both the drinking habit and the drug habit for people that use drugs. Use the same thing.

Tomato juice with hot pepper sauce in it. You know, besides drinking a lot of beer, I used to drink a lot of coffee, too. Like, maybe 40 cups a day.

I was a newspaper reporter. Everywhere I went, people offered me coffee and I drank it. We'd go through a couple of big urns of coffee in the office every day.

I found a substitute for that because I never really liked coffee that well. But I was so used to drinking it. Having the cup in my hand, the hot liquid and everything.

I would drink herbal teas, or even better, this sounds strange, but try it. Get some blackstrap molasses. Put a tablespoon of blackstrap molasses in one cup of very, very hot water.

Stir it up real good. The water's got to be real hot. You know, I've offered that drink to a lot of people.

I've said, Hey, I've got a new brand of chicory coffee. Would you like to try it and see what you think of it? Yeah, sure. So I pour it out and I just keep talking to them about some other subject, not about what they're drinking.

And I talk to them as we drink it and they'll drink it. And usually after a while, they'll say, What kind of coffee did you say this was? Then I'll tell them what it really is. It's kind of interesting.

It doesn't even taste like molasses, but it's delicious. It's always good to have an instead of. Mr. Silva says that if you take a habit away from somebody, you take something away that they're accustomed to, they're going to go back to it unless you come up with a substitute.

So do that for yourself. What is a substitute? The substitute could be something that you want more than the habit. The sleek, sexy body more than the chocolate sundae, for instance.

Being around with your family instead of dying of lung cancer might be enough motivation to get you to stop smoking cigarettes. In this next conditioning, we'll cover the techniques for weight control and then techniques to help you stop smoking. You can use the techniques for any other habits.

Here's how it goes. When you desire to reduce weight, enter level one by the use of the three-to-one method and analyze the weight problem. Always start at level by analyzing the problem.

At level one, you detect certain foods to be causing the problem. Mark a big red no over them, mentally. That way, when you're going to eat, you're going down the line at the cafeteria, you're looking over the menu, that'll be a reminder to you that this is food that could be contributing to the problem.

Now you have a choice. Previously, it was just a habit. You took it.

Now you have a choice. You can choose the food or you can choose success. Which do you want the most? You can program yourself at your level that hunger between meals will vanish by using some substitute for food, for the high-calorie foods, such as eating a piece of carrot or celery or apple, some such healthful foods, or by taking three deep breaths.

Isn't that something? Deep breathing can help you to reach your goals. That's ingesting something into your body, isn't it? You can program yourself at your level to leave something on your plate. Realize you do not need all the food you've taken.

Program yourself, not deep dessert. We have a lot of strong, strong programming for those things, don't we? Eat everything on your plate. There are children in India who are starving.

Someone once said, okay, if you can name one of them for me, I'll go ahead and eat the food. And dessert. Oh, eat your dinner and mommy will reward you with dessert.

She worked all day cooking this cake. There's a lot of emotional content in those things. Program yourself to do what's best for you.

Use the Mirror of the Mind technique. Visualize yourself in the blue frame mirror of the mind the way you are now. Then in the white frame mirror, stamp what you want to weigh on one corner and the size of clothing you want to wear on the other corner.

And imagine yourself at your ideal weight and size. Thereafter, when you think of your weight, always visualize the image that you've created of yourself the way you want to be in the white frame mirror of the mind. Whenever you're eating, visualize that image that you've created of yourself in the white frame mirror of the mind.

Now, if you want to gain weight, eat foods that you sense at level one will help you to gain. Eat slowly, savoring every bite. Learn to improve your taste and smell by concentrating on the food as you eat.

Use the Mirror of the Mind. Visualize yourself the way you want to be. Then we'll cover the cigarette smoking habits.

Make changes little by little by smoking the first cigarette one hour later, one hour later, one hour later. Or you can program yourself to smoke only one cigarette per hour on the hour. When this has become effective, then program yourself to smoke only on the even hours.

After this has taken effect, it'll be a simple matter to stop smoking completely. Postpone it until the hour. You can still look forward to it, but you don't have to do it right away.

You are changing the habit. Use the 30-day technique. Enter your level and program yourself at level one to stop smoking altogether 30 days from the date of your initial programming.

Mark a date on a calendar. Tell yourself that on that date you will not smoke again. You will never smoke again in your life.

You will be a non-smoker. Reinforce this at your level every day, and it'll be so. Remember to help you out, you can change brands frequently.

Smoke brands of cigarettes you don't much like. Do not inhale the cigarette smoke. Go through the habitual motions of raising a cigarette to your mouth and breathing in deeply.

Just don't inhale the smoke. At least you're not doing the most harmful part of that habit. These can be applied to other habits, remember.

Program that three deep breaths will stop the immediate desire to smoke. Fill your lungs with nice clean air, not smoke. You may not be able to see your breath as you exhale, but it sure does feel a lot better.

Take deep breaths. And if nothing else motivates you, stop smoking for the sake of your loved ones. Set a good example for your children.

Think of how sad your loved ones will be if you die young. Now whenever you want to end a habit, any habit at all, use any of these suggestions that seem reasonable to you. Analyze everything at your level and get started.

There are many techniques and suggestions here because each person is different and responds in a different way. Find what works best for you and stick with it. If one technique doesn't give you the results you want, try another one.

The same thing for starting habits. Do the same way. The choice is yours.

If you really want to choose success, remember to enter your level and review your reasons for desiring to succeed. If you really want to have more success in your life, you'll use the tools that we're providing in this course. They work.

If these techniques work for heroin addicts, for smokers, for alcoholics, they'll work for you too. In a research project that involved 15 recovering alcoholics in a halfway house, serious alcoholics, they all took the course. Six months later, 12 of those 15 had not had another drink.

An incredible success rate. And of the three who did have another drink, one had a few drinks and stopped on his own. Another drank for a day or so and then stopped.

Only one needed additional intervention to help him stop. That is a tremendous success rate for hardcore alcoholics. If these techniques are powerful enough for that, they'll work for you.

A key to it is having sufficient desire. They had great desire because their lives were in shambles. If you have enough desire, these techniques will work for you.

If you just have a little desire, the habit may be stronger. So if you need to, go to your level and work on your desire. Do what they did.

Do what those alcoholics did. Use your level, the powerful alpha levels. Take your desire to that level and it will give you all the power, all the energy and all the enthusiasm that you need to succeed.

You have a choice to drink or not to drink, to smoke or not to smoke, to eat or not to eat, to lose your temper or not to lose your temper, to be successful or not be successful. It is your choice. Make a habit of success.

Develop success habits. Get rid of the ones that impede your success. Develop the ones that enhance your success and do it.

If the choice is up to you, let's go forward and do this. Now the conditioning cycle is about 15 minutes long. That includes all of these suggestions for weight control and for smoking.

And a reminder that you can apply them to other habits as well. So when you're ready, choose success. Thank you.
