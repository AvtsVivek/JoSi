You are now at level one, the basic plane level that you are learning to use for a purpose, any purpose you desire. 

To help you enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, I'm going to count from ten to one. On each descending number you will feel yourself going deeper and you will enter a deeper, healthier level of mind. Ten, nine, feel going deeper, eight, seven, six, deeper and deeper, five, four, three, deeper and deeper, two, one. 

You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind, deeper than before. You may enter a deeper, healthier level of mind by simply relaxing your eyelids. Relax your eyelids. 

Feel how relaxed they are. Allow this feeling of relaxation to flow slowly downward throughout your body, all the way down to your toes. It is a wonderful feeling to be deeply relaxed, a very healthy state of being. 

To help you enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, I'm going to count from one to three. At that moment you will project yourself mentally to your ideal place of relaxation. I will then stop talking to you and when you next hear my voice, one hour of time will have elapsed at this level of mind. 

My voice will not startle you. You will take a deep breath, relax and go deeper. One, two, three. 

Project yourself mentally to your ideal place of relaxation until you hear my voice again. Relax, relax. Take a deep breath and as you exhale, relax and go deeper. 

You will continue to listen to my voice. You will continue to follow the instructions at this level of the mind and any other level, including the outer conscious level. This is for your benefit. You desire it and it is so. Whenever you mentally or verbally mention the word relax, all unnecessary movements and activities of your body, brain and mind will cease immediately and you will become completely passive and relaxed physically and mentally. I may bring you out of this level or a deeper level than this by counting to you from one to five. 

At the count of five, your eyes will open. You will be wide awake feeling fine and in perfect health. The difference between genius mentality and lay mentality is that geniuses use more of their minds and use them in a special manner. 

You are now learning to use more of your mind and to use it in a special manner. The following are beneficial statements that you may occasionally repeat while at these levels of the mind. Repeat mentally after me. 

My increasing mental faculties are for serving humanity better. Every day in every way I am getting better, better and better. Positive thoughts bring me benefits and advantages I desire. 

I have full control and complete dominion over my sensing faculties at this level of the mind and any other level including the outer conscious level. And this is so. The following statements are for your protection. 

This is mind control, your own self mind control. You are always in control. You may accept or reject anything I say, anytime, at any level of the mind. 

You are always in control. The following preventive statements are for your better health. Keep in mind that from now on I will occasionally be speaking in your place.

I will never learn to develop physically or mentally a dependence on drugs or alcohol. Negative thoughts and negative suggestions have no influence over me at any level of the mind. 

I will always maintain a perfectly healthy body and mind. Mental projection statements for success. I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to any problem area so as to become aware of any abnormalities if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity.

You will mentally have chalk in one hand and an eraser in the other. You will then mentally draw a large circle on the chalkboard. Then you will mentally draw a big X within the circle. 

You will then proceed to erase the X from within the circle, starting at the center and erasing towards the inner edges of the circle, being careful not to erase the circle in the least.

You will then write a big number 100 within the circle. Then you will erase the number 100, being careful not to erase the circle in the least. Once the number 100 is erased, to the right and outside of the circle, you will go over the word deeper.
