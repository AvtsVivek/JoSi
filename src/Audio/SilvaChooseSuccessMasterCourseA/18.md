This is the mental rehearsal conditioning exercise of the SILVA method. Now prepare for this mind training exercise by finding a comfortable position. We will start this exercise with the three-to-one method.

Find a comfortable position, close your eyes, take a deep breath and while exhaling mentally repeat and visualize the number three, three times. Take another deep breath and while exhaling mentally repeat and visualize the number two, three times. Take another deep breath and while exhaling mentally repeat and visualize the number one, three times.

You are now at level one, the basic plane level that you are learning to use for a purpose, any purpose you desire. To help you enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, I'm going to count from ten to one. On each descending number you will feel yourself going deeper and you will enter a deeper, healthier level of mind.

Ten, nine, feel going deeper, eight, seven, six, deeper and deeper, five, four, three, deeper and deeper, two, one. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind, deeper than before. You may enter a deeper, healthier level of mind by simply relaxing your eyelids. 

Relax your eyelids. Feel how relaxed they are. Allow this feeling of relaxation to flow slowly downward throughout your body, all the way down to your toes.

It is a wonderful feeling to be deeply relaxed, a very healthy state of being. To help you enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, I'm going to count from one to three. At that moment you will project yourself mentally to your ideal place of relaxation.

I will then stop talking to you and when you next hear my voice, one hour of time will have elapsed at this level of mind. My voice will not startle you. You will take a deep breath, relax and go deeper.

One, two, three. Project yourself mentally to your ideal place of relaxation until you hear my voice again. Relax.

Relax. Relax. Take a deep breath and as you exhale, relax and go deeper.

You will continue to listen to my voice. You will continue to follow the instructions at this level of the mind and any other level, including the outer conscious level. This is for your benefit. 

You desire it and it is so. Whenever you mentally or verbally mention the word relax, all unnecessary movements and activities of your body, brain and mind will cease immediately and you will become completely passive and relaxed, physically and mentally. I may bring you out of this level or a deeper level than this by counting to you from one to five.

At the count of five, your eyes will open. You will be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health. The difference between genius mentality and lay mentality is that geniuses use more of their minds and use them in a special manner.

You are now learning to use more of your mind and to use it in a special manner. The following are beneficial statements that you may occasionally repeat while at these levels of the mind. Repeat mentally after me.

My increasing mental faculties are for serving humanity better. Every day, in every way, I am getting better, better and better. Positive thoughts bring me benefits and advantages. 

I desire, I have full control and complete dominion over my sensing faculties at this level of the mind and any other level, including the outer conscious level. And this is so. The following preventive statements are for your better health. 

Keep in mind that from now on, I will occasionally be speaking in your place. I will never learn to develop, physically or mentally, mental disorders nor psychosomatic or functional ailments or diseases. I will never learn to develop, physically or mentally, a dependence on drugs or alcohol.

Negative thoughts and negative suggestions have no influence over me at any level of the mind. I will always maintain a perfectly healthy body and mind. Mental projection statements for success.

I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to any problem area, so as to become aware of any abnormalities, if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. I am now learning to apply corrective measures and to correct any abnormality I detect. Negative thoughts and negative suggestions have no influence over me at any level of the mind.

We will now impress information for your benefit, programming the Mental Rehearsal Technique, a formula-type technique that you can use to help you improve your physical performance. When you have an activity to perform and you desire to rehearse it mentally ahead of time, enter level 1 with the 3-to-1 method and then project yourself mentally to the location where you will perform the activity. Once you have projected yourself mentally to the place where you will perform the activity, imagine yourself performing the way you desire.

Imagine yourself improving and accomplishing your task successfully. Notice how you feel as you are performing the task. Imagine how you feel as you begin the activity the way that you desire.

Imagine how you feel as you progress in the activity. A quarter of the way through it. Halfway through it.

Three quarters of the way through it. Imagine feeling successful and imagine a sense of accomplishment as you succeed at your assigned task. I will now allow you time to practice your learned techniques.

When you hear my voice again, you will relax even more. In the next session, we will program habit control, formula-type techniques that you can learn to use to control the eating habit or to reduce or gain weight. We will also program formula-type techniques that you can use to control, reduce, or stop the smoking habit.

You will also be able to apply the techniques to other habits. Every time you function at these levels of the mind, you will receive beneficial effects physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind to help yourself physically and mentally.

You may use these levels of the mind to help your loved ones physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind to help any human being who needs help physically and mentally. You will never use these levels of the mind to harm any human being.

If this be your intention, you will not be able to function within these levels of the mind. You will always use these levels of the mind in a constructive, creative manner for all that is good, honest, pure, clean, and positive, and this is so. You will continue to strive to take part in constructive and creative activities to make this a better world to live in, so that when we move on, we shall have left behind a better world for those who follow.

You will consider the whole of humanity, depending on their ages, as fathers or mothers, brothers or sisters, sons or daughters. You are a superior human being. You have greater understanding, compassion, and patience with others.

In a moment, I'm going to count from one to five. At that moment, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. You will have no ill effects whatsoever in your head, no headache, no ill effects whatsoever in your hearing, no buzzing in your ears, no ill effects whatsoever in your vision and eyesight.

Vision, eyesight, and hearing improve every time you function at these levels of mind. One. Two.

Coming out slowly now. Three. At the count of five, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before.

Feeling the way you feel when you have slept the right amount of revitalizing, refreshing, relaxing, healthy, wonderful sleep. Four. Five. 

Eyes open, wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. This concludes the mental rehearsal exercise for the Silva Method. Thank you.
