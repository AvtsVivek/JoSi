This is the Weight and Habit Control Conditioning Exercise of the Silva Method. Prepare for this mind training exercise by finding a comfortable position. We will start this exercise with the 3 to 1 method.

Find a comfortable position, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number 3, 3 times. Take another deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number 2, 3 times. Take another deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number 1, 3 times.

You are now at level 1, the basic plane level that you are learning to use for a purpose, any purpose you desire. To help you enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, I'm going to count from 10 to 1. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going deeper, and you will enter a deeper, healthier level of mind. 10, 9, feel going deeper.

8, 7, 6, deeper and deeper. 5, 4, 3, deeper and deeper. 2, 1. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind, deeper than before.

You may enter a deeper, healthier level of mind by simply relaxing your eyelids. Relax your eyelids. Feel how relaxed they are.

Allow this feeling of relaxation to flow slowly downward throughout your body, all the way down to your toes. It is a wonderful feeling to be deeply relaxed, a very healthy state of being. To help you enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, I'm going to count from 1 to 3. At that moment, you will project yourself mentally to your ideal place of relaxation.

I will then stop talking to you, and when you next hear my voice, one hour of time will have elapsed at this level of mind. My voice will not startle you. You will take a deep breath, relax, and go deeper.

1, 2, 3. Project yourself mentally to your ideal place of relaxation until you hear my voice again. Relax. Relax.

Relax. Take a deep breath, and as you exhale, relax and go deeper. You will continue to listen to my voice.

You will continue to follow the instructions at this level of the mind and any other level, including the outer conscious level. This is for your benefit. You desire it, and it is so.

Whenever you mentally or verbally mention the word relax, all unnecessary movements and activities of your body, brain, and mind will cease immediately, and you will become completely passive and relaxed, physically and mentally. I may bring you out of this level or a deeper level than this by counting to you from 1 to 5. At the count of 5, your eyes will open, you will be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health. The difference between genius mentality and lay mentality is that geniuses use more of their minds and use them in a special manner.

You are now learning to use more of your mind and to use it in a special manner. The following are beneficial statements that you may occasionally repeat while at these levels of the mind. Repeat mentally after me.

My increasing mental faculties are for serving humanity better. Every day in every way, I am getting better, better, and better. Positive thoughts bring me benefits and advantages I desire.

I have full control and complete dominion over my sensing faculties at this level of the mind and any other level, including the outer conscious level. And this is so. The following preventive statements are for your better health.

Keep in mind that from now on I will occasionally be speaking in your place. I will never learn to develop, physically or mentally, mental disorders, nor psychosomatic or functional ailments or diseases. I will never learn to develop, physically or mentally, a dependence on drugs or alcohol.

Negative thoughts and negative suggestions have no influence over me at any level of the mind. I will always maintain a perfectly healthy body and mind. Mental projection statements for success.

I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to any problem area so as to become aware of any abnormalities, if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. I am now learning to apply corrective measures and to correct any abnormality I detect. Negative thoughts and negative suggestions have no influence over me at any level of the mind.

We will now impress and program habit control, formula type techniques you can use to control the eating and smoking habits. Formula type techniques for habit control, weight. First, when you desire to reduce weight, enter level 1 by the use of the 3 to 1 method and analyze your weight problem.

At level 1, mentally mark a big red no over every item of food considered to be causing the problem. Program yourself that hunger between meals will vanish by eating a piece of carrot, celery or apple or some such helpful foods, or by taking three deep breaths. Program yourself to leave something on your plate, realizing that you do not need all the food you have taken.

Program yourself not to eat dessert. Visualize yourself in the blue-framed mirror of the mind the way you are now. Then, in the white-framed mirror, stamp what you want to weigh on one corner and the size of suit or dress you want to wear on the other corner and imagine yourself at your ideal weight and size.

Thereafter, when you think of your weight, always visualize the image you have created of yourself the way you want to be in the white-framed mirror of the mind. Whenever you are eating, visualize the image you have created of yourself the way you want to look in the white-framed mirror of the mind and visualize your desired weight stamped on one corner and your desired size of clothing stamped on the other corner. If you desire to gain weight, eat those foods that you sense at level 1 will help you gain.

Eat slowly, savoring every bite. Learn to improve your taste and smell by concentrating on your food as you eat. Use the mirror of the mind and visualize yourself the way you want to be.

Do this every time you think of your weight. Formula Type Techniques for Habit Control Smoking Whenever you wish to reduce or discontinue cigarette smoking, enter level 1 by the 3-to-1 method and at level 1, analyze the problem. Determine when you smoked the first cigarette of the day, then program yourself at level 1 to smoke it one hour later.

When that becomes effective, program yourself to smoke the first cigarette still one hour later and continue to make these changes by programming at level 1 until you smoke only a few cigarettes a day. It will then be a simple matter to stop smoking altogether. You can also program yourself to smoke only one cigarette per hour on the hour.

When this has become effective, then program yourself to smoke only on the even hours. After this has taken effect, it will be a simple matter to stop smoking completely. You can also program yourself at level 1 to stop smoking altogether 30 days from the date of your initial programming.

You can mark a date on a calendar 30 days from the present and tell yourself mentally that on this date you will stop smoking and never smoke again in your life. Reinforce this programming for this purpose at level 1 daily, and this will be so. Tips that help in your programming at level 1 to stop smoking.

Change brands frequently. Do not inhale the cigarette smoke. Program that three deep breaths will stop the immediate desire to smoke.

Stop smoking for the sake of your loved ones. In the next session we will program a formula type technique for your benefit. Creation of a mental mentor.

Every time you function at these levels of the mind, you will receive beneficial effects physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind to help yourself physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind to help your loved ones physically and mentally.

You may use these levels of the mind to help any human being who needs help physically and mentally. You will never use these levels of the mind to harm any human being. If this be your intention, you will not be able to function within these levels of the mind.

You will always use these levels of the mind in a constructive, creative manner for all that is good, honest, pure, clean and positive, and this is so. You will continue to strive to take part in constructive and creative activities to make this a better world to live in, so that when we move on we shall have left behind a better world for those who follow. You will consider the whole of humanity, depending on their ages, as fathers or mothers, brothers or sisters, sons or daughters.

You are a superior human being. You have greater understanding, compassion and patience with others. In a moment I'm going to count from one to five.

At that moment you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. You will have no ill effects whatsoever in your head, no headache, no ill effects whatsoever in your hearing, no buzzing in your ears, no ill effects whatsoever in your vision and eyesight. Vision, eyesight and hearing improve every time you function at these levels of mind.
