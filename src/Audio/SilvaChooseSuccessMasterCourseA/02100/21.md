It's very important and valuable to have support systems in your life. You need people who understand you, and love you, and support you in the things that you do. In the Silva Method, we emphasize many kinds of support systems.

Graduate meetings, cottage group meetings, Silva Method graduate support groups, the buddy system, programming partners, anything at all that can help you. You can even have a subjective support system, which is the purpose of the technique on the other side of this tape. It's also very valuable for you to establish a support system with other Silva Method graduates also.

Back in 1966 and 67, when Jose Silva first began teaching the Silva Method in the Texas Panhandle, he found that graduates were supporting one another even though they didn't attend meetings together. They often lived so far apart that they couldn't get together very conveniently, but he said that whenever somebody in a group needed help, then everybody went to work to program for them and to help them. This is the essence of a support group.

People who sincerely desire to help one another. We started a support group here in Laredo kind of by accident back in 1990. It turned out to be the most valuable thing that I'd been involved with since I first took the Basic Lecture Series in 1975.

I'd come to the office once a week and open up, but that's all I did. I left it up to the graduates to decide what to do in our meetings. What we did, we talked to each other, we'd gossip about things, we'd share our successes with each other, we'd talk about our problems and our projects and our goals and our hopes and our dreams.

We really got to know each other intimately. The things that we said in the group stayed in the group. We didn't go talk about them outside and take a chance of embarrassing anybody.

That way, people could really begin to open up. After we talked for a while, we'd arrange our chairs in a circle, and somebody would read the long relaxation exercise to take us all to level together. Once we'd entered a deep level, we'd go around the circle, giving each person an opportunity to ask for help in programming for any project or projects that they had.

We got spectacular results. Everybody was benefiting tremendously. I didn't even know what a support group was, but here we'd established one.

One of our group members explained to me that Alcoholics Anonymous was a support group, so I got a copy of the Alcoholics Anonymous book, what they call the big book, and I read it. It really got me excited. Here's one example of how we helped one another.

One member of our group was trying to sell a house. He'd programmed every detail. He imagined somebody coming to look at the house, making an offer, negotiating, and finally closing the deal, signing the paperwork, depositing the money in the bank.

But nothing was happening. We were all programming with him and helping out, but nothing happened for several weeks. After we had been to level together one night, another group member had some insight.

That's the kind of thing that seemed to happen when we spend that time at level and get to know each other so well. She said, maybe you're trying too hard. Maybe you need to keep it simple.

Well, the next week, the man with the house for sale reported that he'd sold it. I took your advice, he told her. I simplified my programming.

I just imagined pulling up the for sale sign and throwing it away because the house had been sold. And sure enough, a couple of days later, it was sold. We were spending so much time at level together, programming for each other every day, so we got to know each other really well and could offer insights like that all the time.

Everybody was getting great benefits. I realized just how valuable everybody felt our support group was when the group members decided that we would go ahead and hold our regular meetings, which we were holding every Wednesday night, even though the next two meetings were going to fall on Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Did we think that support group was valuable to us? If we were willing to get together and meet on Christmas Day and New Year's Day, you bet we did.

Eventually, I started traveling so much that I couldn't keep up with the group meetings, so now my support group consists of a programming partner. We set a time. We pick 10 o'clock every night that we go to level, wherever she is, wherever I am, and we program for each other.

Two, three times a week, we'll talk to each other on the phone. Every now and then, we get together for lunch, give each other feedback on the results that we're getting from our programming. She lets me know what's happening with hers, her projects, and I let her know what's happening with mine.

That way, we can make any adjustments that are indicated in the programming. This has been working out great for us. You know what's really interesting? That idea didn't come from Jose Silva.

It didn't come from anybody on the Silva International staff. It didn't come from any of our lecturers. It came from one of our support group members, one of the graduates who was a support group member.

She suggested it, and we've been using it ever since, very successfully. Here's a technique that Jose Silva designed especially for this Choose Success Home Study course. It's not taught in a basic lecture series.

Since you are taking this course on your own, rather than with a group of other people, this technique is designed to provide you with some subjective help. Mr. Silva likes to call it an invisible means of support. The idea is to create, at your level, a spiritual duplicate of your favorite teacher, a person that you admire, someone who has helped you and taught you and guided you in your life and in your career.

You can imagine this person encouraging you when you need encouragement. You can imagine this person reminding you of successes that you've had to give you confidence that you'll succeed again in your current projects. Your mental mentor can remind you to remember your points of reference for your successes, to remember how you programmed, how you performed, how you felt, and how it felt when you were successful.

These are things that will help you to be just as successful again and even more successful every time. Remembering your successes is an excellent way to improve yourself. Jose Silva says that we used to be taught to learn from our mistakes, from our failures.

Now, he says, brain and mind research has shown us that there's a better way. Now we know that the best way to achieve great success is to use our smaller successes as stepping stones to bigger successes. A lot of people do this, very successful people.

You can see great athletes doing it all the time. A couple of years back, there was a young tennis player named Zena Garrison who was playing Monica Sellis at Wimbledon. Monica was not yet the number one female tennis player in the world.

That came the next year. She was still awfully good. Zena had lost the first set and was behind in the second set and they just played the best of three.

Monica slammed the ball across the net. Zena lurched for it. She missed it and she fell to the ground.

She fell hard. This was on national television. When she got up, her knees was bleeding.

And even watching it on television, you could see how shaken she was. Now, that's a tough spot to be in, playing a terrific player like Monica Sellis, injured, rattled. And to make it even worse, it was Monica's advantage.

A look at the scoreboard told Zena that if Monica won this next point, she'd win the game. And if she won this game, it would give her the set. And if she won this second set, that was the match.

It was match point. Zena faced elimination from the tournament at Wimbledon, biggest tournament in the world. If she couldn't come back and win the next point, they only allow you 30 seconds between shots.

So she had 30 seconds to compose herself and try to fight off match point. Well, somehow she did it. She managed to get the ball back across the net, win the point.

In fact, she kept winning points and she went on to win that game. She pulled it out. She continued to play well, pulled even with Monica, and went ahead to win the set.

Now, that meant they were tied one set each. They had to play the third set to see who would continue in the tournament and who would be eliminated. Well, Zena Garrison went on to win the third set and the match.

She eliminated a player who was seated much higher than she was. As she was walking off the court after the victory, sportscaster Bud Collins stopped her for an interview. He asked her how she managed to collect herself and come back to win the point and eventually win the match after that bad fall that scraped up her knee so badly.

She told him and a national audience and a worldwide audience that was watching that she just remembered the times in the past when she was in a similar situation, when she was hurt and down match point, times when she was playing junior tennis and faced that over and over again, but she came back to win the match. She had done it before and she believed she could do it again. She was her own role model.

Now, you surely have your own inspirational stories, people who have inspired you, times that you've inspired yourself. Imagine how valuable it will be to remember those positive things when the going gets tough, just like Zena Garrison did. Your mental mentor can remind you of things like that.

Just program it in at your level. Then when you find yourself in a tough situation, imagine what your mental mentor would say to you. Imagine a mental mentor saying, Come on, you can do it.

You've made it in difficult situations before. Remember how you did it. Remember how you felt.

Feel that way again. Come on, you can get there. You can imagine your mental mentor reminding you of all the benefits of succeeding.

Your mental mentor can remind you of all the other people who benefit when you succeed, how you can be a role model for others. Your mental mentor can remind you of how to proceed, what to do each step of the way. Of course, it's great to have a physical mentor too, a person that you can call on to give you ideas and to help you.

But in many ways, this mental mentor technique has advantage over having a physical mentor. For instance, your mental mentor can be with you all the time, never separated from you. And your mental mentor will always know exactly what to say to you because you are in control.

You are the one who's choosing at your level, of course, choosing what your mental mentor should say to you. It's a great technique, one that will help you a lot. It's been very valuable to me since Mr. Silva first told me about it.

To create your mental mentor during this next conditioning cycle, I'll ask you to create and project onto your mental screen a mental picture of this person who has helped you, this person who is one of your favorite teachers. You'll recall what the person looks like, their height and weight, their facial features, their hair. Recall how they move, their gestures, how they talk.

Then you will imagine your mental mentor moving away from the mental screen and becoming dynamic and fully alive. You can imagine talking with your mental mentor at any time. Imagine what your mentor would say.

Imagine how your mentor would guide you and support you and serve as an example for you, as a role model. Your mental mentor can encourage you when you are performing tasks. Simply recall your mental mentor and imagine what he or she would say to you and use this to help you achieve even greater results.

So think of who you want for your mental mentor. If you're not sure, then enter your level and think about it. You'll come up with more ideas and make a better decision at your level.

Now, let's go listen in on Jose Silva as he talks to a group here in Laredo about how he helped the artists that he taught in Amarillo, Texas, back in 1966, the very first public class that he had, how he helped them with the concept of a master artist who could help them become better painters. Now, let's listen in on Jose Silva as he describes what he did with those artists, the basic concept of the mental mentor that you'll be using. Here he is.

Well, she wanted to be a painter. She was not there yet to study. Painter.

I selected the wrong person. I should have selected a painter. There was already a painter, not just one in training, you see.

Anyway, I said, you should use your imagination on this, you know, as a painter. Can you imagine? Who do you like to paint like? Oh, like Van Gogh. Well, great. 

This is very good. I mean, a lot of people like Van Gogh's painting. Have you read Van Gogh's history? Oh, she knows it back and forth.

Her idol, Van Gogh. She wants to ultimately be a painter like Van Gogh. Well, all right, let's create a Van Gogh right by your side, I said.

How's that? What do you mean? I mean, like drawing one, you know, like sculpturing one. I mean, work on his hair. And say, well, I want to say the head is right here, and the shoulders are here.

And you go ahead and create one. A Van Gogh, a spiritual Van Gogh. And let him be on your side here.

And she went and did this, you see. Have you created, painted, or sculpted a Van Gogh? Yes, he's right here right now. All right.

Now, whenever you're painting, and you meet a problem in painting, bring your three fingers together, grab one hand, and the other hand, like this, one or the other, and then imagine Van Gogh, ask him what to do. And whatever comes to your mind is his answer. Follow it up and continue.

So, come out. She went and got her easel, and got her tripod or whatever, or her oil thing, whatever. Everybody gather around, the whole class.

And she started to paint. First, she penciled, half-drew, whatever. She wanted to draw a vase with flowers and a table, cloth, and went like this, you know.

Sketching, and then got the paint, oils. I had never seen anybody paint like this. Paint was paint, you know.

But she went with the brush, the tip of the brush going like this. That's what she went to do. And in no time at all, she had a beautiful vase of flowers.

Everybody, wow, look at this, what she's doing. And so fast, you know. Everybody amazed, you see.

I mean, I didn't know any better anyway. At this time, when this was going on, Professor Dort comes in. What's this commotion about? So they told him what was happening.

Oh, okay, let's gather around. Let's analyze the painting and see if he appears to like Van Gogh's work. He liked this kind of work, you know.

He said, you know, he does appear to like Van Gogh's work. Even to the spots here that Van Gogh used to have, some of the canvas aren't exposed, you see. Didn't cover the paint.

Little bit here and there. Even that's here, see. But I didn't know anything like this.

I didn't know the techniques, whatever. And the mistake I made was I selected a person who only had two classes in art. I thought she was one of the professors there, or the advanced students or something.

I made a mistake. I didn't know any better. Now that's what really turned them on.

She doing this, Mary doing this. She's not supposed to do that with 22 lessons in art, you see. Now everybody wanted me to train them with their da Vinci's, their Rembrandt's, and all that.

I got myself a lot of work there because of that one. I had to work with each one individually to get whatever they wanted. Da Vinci's, Rembrandt's, and whatever.

Okay, so decide who you want for your mental mentor. Someone who will be there to help you in what you do and the things that are important to you. And once you've decided, enter your level and program the technique.

This conditioning cycle lasts approximately 15 minutes. Thank you.
