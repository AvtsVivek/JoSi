the four supervillains of learning
“four horsemen” of our age: digital deluge, digital distraction, digital dementia, and digital deduction.

The following is not very clear. 
With downtime, the neurons made their way from the gateway of memory to the rest of the brain, where long-term memory is stored.
What is gateway of memory? 

Due to digital deduction, the “muscles” we use to think critically and reason effectively are atrophying. We’re letting technology do the deduction for us. And if
technology is forming our deductions, then we are also ceding much of our problem-solving ability


Which of the four digital villains do you believe are currently most disrupting your performance, productivity, and peace of mind? Take a moment and write the name of this villain down. Conscious awareness is the first part to solving a problem.

My answer is "digital distraction". I use my work laptop the most. When I am working, I use Youtube. This is a distraction for me.
