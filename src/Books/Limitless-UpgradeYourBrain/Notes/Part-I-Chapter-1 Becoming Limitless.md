Where would I get the time? So I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep, I didn’t exercise, I didn’t watch television or spend time with friends. Instead, I practically lived at the library, until one night when I passed out from sheer exhaustion and fell down a flight of stairs, sustaining yet another head injury.

“No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it.”

I could better recall information that I had studied weeks before with little difficulty. My problem is exactly this. 


A limit in your Mindset—you entertain a low belief in yourself, your capabilities, what you deserve, or what is possible.

A limit in your Motivation—you lack the drive, purpose, or energy to take action.

A limit in your Methods—you were taught and are acting on a process that is not effective to create the results you desire.

Mindset (the WHAT): deeply held beliefs, attitudes, and assumptions we create about who we are, how the world works, what we are capable of and deserve, and what is possible.

Motivation (the WHY): the purpose one has for taking action. The energy required for someone to behave in a particular way.

Method (the HOW): a specific process for accomplishing something, especially an orderly, logical, or systematic way of instruction.

One other note about the diagram on the previous page. You’ll see that where mindset crosses over with motivation, I have the word `inspiration`. You’re inspired, but you don’t know which methods to employ or where to channel your energy.

Where motivation and method intersect, you have `implementation`. In this case, your results are going to be limited to what you feel you deserve, what you feel you are capable of, and what you believe is possible because you lack the proper mindset.

Where mindset and method intersect, you have `ideation`. Your ambitions stay in your mind, because you lack the energy to do anything about them. 

Where all three intersect, you have the `limitless state`. You then have the fourth I, which is `integration`.

In Part II, Limitless Mindset, you’ll learn what is possible when you eradicate limiting beliefs.

In Part III, Limitless Motivation, you’ll discover why your purpose is your power and keys to unleash your drive and energy.

In Part IV, Limitless Methods, you’ll discover how to learn at your best with proven processes—the tools and techniques that will propel you forward toward the life you desire and deserve.


The second chapter is about 4 villians or four horse men.
Digital Deluge, Digital dementia etc.

Meta learning(learning how to learn)

Telling a child to do things like “concentrate” is like telling them to play the ukulele; it’s very difficult to do without ever being taught how.

Ukulele is a guitar like instrument.

If knowledge is power, then learning is our superpower.

For so much of my life, I allowed myself to be defined by my perceived restrictions.

1. If we never let our mind wander or be bored for a moment, we pay a price—poor memory, mental fog, and fatigue.
