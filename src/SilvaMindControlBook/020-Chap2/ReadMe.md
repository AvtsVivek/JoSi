Meet Josi

1. Jose knew from his work in electronics that the ideal circuit is the one with the least resistance, or impedance because it makes the greatest use of its electrical energy. 

2. Would the brain work more effectively too if its impedance were lowered? And can its impedance be lowered?

3. Jose began using hypnosis to quiet the minds of his children and he discovered what to many appeared to be a paradox. 

   1. He found that the `brain was more energetic when it was less active`. 
   2. At `lower frequencies the brain received and stored more information`. 
   3. The crucial `problem was to keep the mind alert at these frequencies`, which are associated more with `daydreaming and sleep` than with `practical activity`.
   4. `practical activity` means beta or gamma leves.

4. `Hypnosis` permitted the `receptivity` Josi was looking for, but `not` the kind of `independent thought` that leads to reasoning things out so they can be understood. `Having a head full of remembered facts is not enough; insight and understanding are necessary, too`.

5. Jose was the first person to prove that we can learn to function with `awareness` at the `Alpha and Theta` frequencies of the brain.
