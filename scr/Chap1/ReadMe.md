- `Beta`: When you are `wide awake`, doing and achieving in the workaday world, you are in Beta, or `outer consciousness`, to use Mind Control terminology. Being in Beta, or `wide awake`, does not produce any one particular feeling. You might feel confident or fearful, busy or idle, engrossed or bored â€” the `possibilities in Beta are endless`.

- Apha: When you are `daydreaming`, or `just going to sleep but not quite there yet`, or `just awakening but not yet awake`, you are in Alpha. Mind Control people call this `timer consciousness`. 
  
- When you are `asleep` you are in `Alpha, Theta, or Delta, not just Alpha alone`, as many believe. With Mind Control training you can enter the Alpha level at will and still remain fully alert

- The mind at a very low frequency `like Delta, Theta or Alph`, we call the mind is at `deeper levels`.
