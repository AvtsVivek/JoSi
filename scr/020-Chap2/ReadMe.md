Meet Josi

1. Jose began using hypnosis to quiet the minds of his children and he discovered what to many appeared to be a paradox. 

   1. He found that the `brain was more energetic when it was less active`. 
   2. At `lower frequencies the brain received and stored more information`. 
   3. The crucial `problem was to keep the mind alert at these frequencies`, which are associated more with `daydreaming and sleep` than with `practical activity`.

2. `Hypnosis` permitted the `receptivity` Josi was looking for, but `not` the kind of `independent thought` that leads to reasoning things out so they can be understood. `Having a head full of remembered facts is not enough; insight and understanding are necessary, too`.
