How to meditate

1. Reach the `Alpha`, or `meditative level of mind`. Page 30, Para 2

2. Steps
   1. When you awaken in the morning, go to the bathroom if necessary, then return to bed. Set your alarm for fifteen minutes later in case you drift off to sleep during the exercise. 

   2. I think, you do this sitting not lying on the bed. Close your eyes and look upward, behind your eyelids, at a 20-degree angle. For reasons not fully understood, this position of the eyes alone will trigger the mind to go into the state of Alpha.

   3. Now, slowly, at about two-second intervals, count backward from one hundred to one. As you do this, keep your mind on it, and you will be in Alpha the very first time

   4. When we awaken in the morning we are often in Alpha for a while. To go from Theta, the sleep level, to Beta, the awake level, we must pass; through Alpha, and often we linger there through our early-morning routine.

3. Reach the meditation level from alpha every morning for 50 days.

4. Then during the day when you are in beta, practice reaching alpha for 30 days. Each day, you have to do three times. 

5. When you reach your meditation level, what do you do? Visualization.

6. What is Visualization? 

   1. The first step is to create a tool for visualization, a mental screen. It should be like a large movie screen but should not quite fill your mental vision. Imagine it not behind your eyelids but about six feet in front of you. You will project onto this screen whatever you choose to concentrate on.

   2. Once you have built this screen in your mind, project onto it something familiar and simple, like an orange or an apple. Each time you go to your level, stay with just one image; you may change it the next time. Concentrate on making it more and more real â€” in three dimensions, in full color, in all its details. Think of nothing else.

   3. Attend exclusively to the job of creating a simple image more and more vividly. In the beginning, as thoughts intrude, be gently forgiving. Slowly push them away and return to the single object at hand. Becoming irritated or tense will bring you right out of Alpha.

7. This `mind` is very powerful. Once we learn to use our `inteligence` to train `it(our mind)`, it will do some astounding things for us.

8. Using your `inteligence`, train your `mind` to go quietly into Alpha and to attend exclusively to the job of creating a simple image more and more vividly. In the beginning, as thoughts intrude, be gently forgiving. Slowly push them away and return to the single object at hand. Becoming irritated or tense will bring you right out of Alpha.
