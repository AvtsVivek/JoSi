# DYNAMIC MEDITATION

1. The passive meditation can be reached by other means, like focusing on OOM sound or some chants etc. But the easiest is counting backwords.

2. The objective of this chapter is to go beyond this passive meditation, train your mind for organized, dynamic activities to solve some problems.

3. Before you go to your level, think of something pleasant—no matter how trivial—that happened yesterday or today. Review it briefly in your mind, then go well into your level and project onto your mental screen the total incident. 
   1. What were the sights, the smells, the sounds, and your feelings at that time? All the details. 
   2. You will be surprised at the difference between your `Beta memory` of the incident and your `Alpha recall of it`. 
   3. It is almost as great as the difference between saying the word "swim" and actually swimming.

4. How you can use that?
   1. Find a thing thats misplaced, say your purse or keys, would take a little searching to find.
   2. Go to your level, think back to when you had them last, and relive that moment. Now proceed forward in time and you will locate them if they are where you left them.
   3. If someone else took them, you have another kind of problem to solve, which requires much more advanced techniques
   4. Imagine the student who remembers his instructor saying there will he an exam tins Wednesday—or did he say next Wednesday? He can settle it for himself in Alpha.

5. Desirable to real event Laws

   1. 1st Law. You must `desire` that the event take place. For example, Your boss will be more agreeable, or a certain customer will be more receptive to what you are selling.

   2. 2nd Law. You must `believe` the event can take place. If your customer is overstocked with what you would like to sell, you cannot reasonably believe he will be eager to buy.

   3. 4rd Law. You must `expect the` event to take place. This is a subtle law. The first two are simple and passive—— this third one introduces some dynamics. It is possible to desire an event, believe it can take place, and still not expect it to take place. You want your boss to be pleasant tomorrow, you know that he can be, but you may still be some distance from expecting it. 

   4. 4th Law. You cannot induce -ve thoughts in alpha. You cannot create a problem. If you try to do , you will be in popped out to beta, you can no longer be in alpha. 
      1. "Wouldn't it be great if I could get my boss to make such an ass of himself that he'll be fired and I'll get his job?" When you are working dynamically in Alpha you are in touch with Higher Intelligence, and from the perspective of Higher Intelligence it would not be great at all. You may trip up your boss and get him fired, but you will be entirely on your own—and in Beta. 
      2. There is plenty of evil on this planet, and we humans perpetrate more than our share of it. This is done in `Beta`, not `Alpha`, `Theta` or `delta`.
      3. Try giveing someone a headache. If you visualize this "event" as vividly as necessary to accomplish anything at all, then You, not your intended victim, will get the headache and/or you will snap out of Alpha.

6. Choosing an event that is a solution to a problem, that you `desire`, `believe` can come about and, with the following exercise, will learn to `expect`. Say your boss has been ill-tempered lately. 

   1. Step 1.  On your mental screen, thoroughly re-create a recent event which involved the problem. Relive it for a moment.

   2. Step 2. Gently push this scene off the screen to the right. Slide onto the screen another scene that will take place tomorrow. In this scene everyone around the boss is cheerful and the boss is on the receiving end of good news. He is clearly in a better mood now. You know specifically what was causing the problem, visualize the solution at work. Visualize it as vividly as you did the problem.

   3. Step 3. Now push this scene off the screen to the right and replace it with another from the left The boss is happy now, fully as pleasant as you know he can be. Experience this scene as vividly as if it had actually happened. Stay with it for a while, get the full feel of it. 
   
   4. Now, at the count of five you will be wide awake feeling better than before.
