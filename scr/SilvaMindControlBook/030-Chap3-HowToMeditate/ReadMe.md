How to meditate

1. Worries and guilt feelings are absent while you are meditating(Alpha level). At the Alpha level, you cannot bring your feelings of guilt and anger with you. If these feelings intrude you
will simply pop out of the meditative level. As time goes on, they will stay away longer, until one day they are gone for good.

2. Reach the `Alpha`, or `meditative level of mind`. Page 30, Para 2. The alpha level is also called the `day dreaming state`.

3. When you are in alpha state, you are operating in both the left and right hemispheres of brain. When you operate from both sides of your brain, you are able to take ideas about what you desire to happen in your life, which is a left brain function, and simultaneously vizualize them as if they have already occured, which is a right brain function. 
   1. We can do that without any Cognitive dissonance. 
   2. Cognitive dissonance means mental disturbance. 
   3. This is described as the mental disturbance people feel when they realize their cognitions and actions are inconsistent or contradictory

4. Steps
   1. When you awaken in the morning, go to the bathroom if necessary, then return to bed. Set your alarm for fifteen minutes later in case you drift off to sleep during the exercise. 

   2. I think, you do this sitting not lying on the bed. Close your eyes and look upward, behind your eyelids, at a 20-degree angle. For reasons not fully understood, this position of the eyes alone will trigger the mind to go into the state of Alpha.

   3. Now, slowly, at about two-second intervals, count backward from one hundred to one. As you do this, keep your mind on it, and you will be in Alpha the very first time

   4. When we awaken in the morning we are often in Alpha for a while. To go from Theta, the sleep level, to Beta, the awake level, we must pass; through Alpha, and often we linger there through our early-morning routine.

5. Reach the meditation level from alpha every morning for 50 days.

6. Then during the day when you are in beta, practice reaching alpha for 30 days. Each day, you have to do three times. 

7. When you reach your meditation level, what do you do? Visualization.

8.  What is Visualization? 

   1. The first step is to create a tool for visualization, a mental screen. It should be like a large movie screen but should not quite fill your mental vision. Imagine it not behind your eyelids but about six feet in front of you. You will project onto this screen whatever you choose to concentrate on.

   2. Once you have built this screen in your mind, project onto it something familiar and simple, like an orange or an apple. Each time you go to your level, stay with just one image; you may change it the next time. Concentrate on making it more and more real â€” in three dimensions, in full color, in all its details. Think of nothing else.

   3. Attend exclusively to the job of creating a simple image more and more vividly. In the beginning, as thoughts intrude, be gently forgiving. Slowly push them away and return to the single object at hand. Becoming irritated or tense will bring you right out of Alpha.

9.  This `mind` is very powerful. Once we learn to use our `inteligence` to train `it(our mind)`, it will do some astounding things for us.

10. Using your `inteligence`, train your `mind` to go quietly into Alpha and to attend exclusively to the job of creating a simple image more and more vividly. In the beginning, as thoughts intrude, be gently forgiving. Slowly push them away and return to the single object at hand. Becoming irritated or tense will bring you right out of Alpha.


## Questions
1. After awake in the morning, should we sit on the bed or lie flat on the bed to start counting and go to alpha?
2. And for how long should we stay in alpha? I think, 15 minutes.

## New words and phrases.

1. `lurches willy-nilly`. Something moves in an unpredictable or disorganized way. For example, you might describe a dance as "lurching willy-nilly" if it moves from one mood to another without any order.
